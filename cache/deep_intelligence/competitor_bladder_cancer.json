ADC expansion beyond EV is visible via HER2-targeted disitamab vedotin (DV) combinations, while perioperative/adjuvant immunotherapy (durvalumab platforms; ctDNA-guided atezolizumab) continues to migrate upstream. For Avelumab (Bavencio) 1L maintenance, the chemo-first patient pool is under pressure as EV+P dominates 1L and perioperative strategies advance; post-EV sequencing and biomarker‑defined niches (FGFR, HER2) are strategic. Priority actions: 1) Intensify education on optimal sequencing post-EV and positioning when chemo-first remains preferred, 2) Engage KOLs on HER2/Nectin‑4 testing and post-EV pathways, 3) Generate/curate comparative RWE to defend chemo→avelumab maintenance in appropriate centers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview\nContext current as of January 2025. Verify critical details with latest NCCN/ESMO guidelines.\n\n### 1.1 Current Treatment Paradigm in Bladder Cancer\n- NCCN 2025 and ESMO 2024 eUpdate\n  - Metastatic/locally advanced UC (la/mUC):\n    - 1L across cisplatin eligibility: EV+pembrolizumab is preferred based on superior OS/PFS vs gemcitabine/platinum.\n    - 1L cisplatin-eligible option: Nivolumab+gemcitabine/cisplatin (CheckMate‑901) is approved and guideline-endorsed.\n    - 1L chemo-first path: For centers/patients remaining on platinum (gem/cis or gem/carbo), avelumab (Bavencio) 1L maintenance is standard-of-care for non-progressors.\n  - Post‑EV progression: Unmet need; options include switch chemotherapy and erdafitinib for susceptible FGFR2/3 alterations.\n  - Perioperative/MIBC: Rapidly evolving. EV+pembrolizumab (EV-303/KEYNOTE‑B15) met dual primaries at interim (Aug 2025) and may re-shape curative‑intent care; multiple perioperative IO/ADC strategies are maturing.\n\n- Treatment sequence (typical, recognizing center variability)\n  - 1L: EV+pembro (dominant) or nivolumab+GC (cis‑eligible) or platinum chemo alone (declining share).\n  - 1L maintenance: Avelumab for non‑progressors after platinum chemo.\n  - 2L/3L+: If EV used 1L, options include chemotherapy; if chemo used 1L (without EV), EV monotherapy is active; biomarker‑driven options include erdafitinib (FGFR2/3+); clinical trials increasingly split by HER2/Nectin‑4/FGFR status.\n\n- Where Bavencio fits\n  - Avelumab remains the only PD‑(L)1 therapy with proven OS benefit as switch‑maintenance after 1L platinum in la/mUC; it is embedded in NCCN/ESMO for patients managed with chemotherapy first.\n  - Strategic dependence on the size of the chemo-first pool; requires clear guidance on patient selection, safety, and sequencing in the EV+P era.\n\n### 1.2 Approved Competitive Drugs\n- EV (enfortumab vedotin) + pembrolizumab\n  - 1L la/mUC: Full (traditional) approval in Dec 2023; entrenched in 2024–2025 practice across cis‑eligibility.\n- Nivolumab\n  - 1L cisplatin-eligible: With GC (CM‑901) approved Mar 6, 2024.\n  - Adjuvant high‑risk MIUC: Approved based on CheckMate‑274.\n- Pembrolizumab\n  - Combined with EV as 1L standard; monotherapy utility is reduced in mUC by EV+P dominance, but persists in select contexts per guidelines/labels.\n- Atezolizumab\n  - No current broad US/EU mUC approval in the metastatic setting; major ongoing perioperative/adjuvant programs (e.g., ctDNA‑guided strategies).\n- Durvalumab\n  - No mUC label; multiple phase 2/3 perioperative/NMIBC programs.\n- Sacituzumab govitecan\n  - mUC indication voluntarily withdrawn in 2024, consolidating EV’s role post‑platinum.\n- Erdafitinib\n  - FGFR2/3‑altered la/mUC: Approved in post‑platinum settings.\n- Disitamab vedotin (RC48)\n  - HER2‑targeted ADC with approvals in China; global phase 3 programs (including PD‑1 combinations) progressing.\n\n### 1.3 EMD Serono’s Competitive Position\n- Avelumab (Bavencio) 1L maintenance remains the standard for patients receiving platinum chemotherapy first, with mature OS data and broad guideline endorsement.\n- Differentiators\n  - Proven OS benefit as maintenance after chemo; defined, protocolized timing for switch‑maintenance; tolerability suitable for continuation after cytotoxic therapy.\n- Competitive threats\n  - Upfront EV+P reduces the chemo-first pool; perioperative EV+P and IO strategies may reduce future metastatic presentations.\n  - Biomarker‑segmented entrants (HER2 ADCs like disitamab vedotin ± PD‑1; niche FGFR inhibitors) could redirect segments away from chemotherapy-first pathways.\n  - Post‑EV sequencing data gaps create vulnerability unless Medical Affairs leads on evidence synthesis for post‑EV pathways and identifies patient subsets best served by chemo→maintenance.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

LBA112 — TAR‑200 + cetrelimab — Device‑IO neoadjuvant\n   - Phase: 2 (primary analysis)\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Bladder‑preserving paradigm with localized delivery; may reduce need for systemic 1L approaches downstream.\n\n4. LBA8/3110eP — ctDNA‑guided adjuvant atezolizumab — MRD‑driven IO\n   - Phase: 3/economic\n   - Why This Is a Threat: If ctDNA guidance succeeds, earlier IO reduces metastatic recurrences; fewer candidates for maintenance.\n\n5. LBA110/1513O — Nivolumab + anti–GDF‑15 — Immunometabolic combination\n   - Phase: 2/LTFU\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Novel biology to deepen responses in neoadjuvant and R/R; broadens IO combinations beyond PD‑(L)1 monotherapy.\n\n6. 3070MO — LY3866288 FGFR3 inhibitor — Selective targeted therapy\n   - Phase: 1\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Precision expansion for FGFR3‑altered tumors; competitive with erdafitinib and may define post‑EV biomarker sequences.\n\n### 2.4 Geographic and Institutional Patterns\nGeographic Distribution:\n- United States:\n  - Icahn Mount Sinai (3068O) — Adjuvant nivolumab 5‑yr update\n  - MSKCC (3089P, 3102P) — EV+P outcomes in subgroups/genomics\n  - MD Anderson (3094P) — Prognostic score validation for EV+P\n  - Dana‑Farber (3108P) — EV neurotoxicity biomarkers\n  - UCSF (3074P) — EV±P long‑term follow‑up\n  - UCLA (3070MO) — FGFR3 inhibitor dose‑finding\n  - Sarah Cannon (967P) — Next‑gen Nectin‑4 ADC early phase\n\n- Europe:\n  - San Raffaele, Milan (LBA110, LBA112) — Neoadjuvant IO/Device‑IO\n  - Maria Middelares/CORE Antwerp (LBA2) — Periop EV+P\n  - NKI, Amsterdam (3069MO) — NIAGARA HRQoL (durva+chemo)\n  - Med Univ Vienna/Charité (LBA108) — NMIBC durva+BCG\n  - Sorbonne/CCAFU, Paris (LBA107) — NMIBC atezo+BCG\n  - Kantonsspital Graubünden, CH (3106P, 3107P) — Periop chemo‑IO ± rBCG\n  - Univ Hospital Bonn (3087P, 3090P) — NECTIN‑4 biomarker validation\n  - Univ Hospital Cologne (3100P) — NECTIN‑4 in CNS metastases\n  - Barts/QMUL, London (LBA8) — ctDNA‑guided adjuvant IO\n\n- Asia/China:\n  - Renji Hospital, Shanghai (3071MO) — DV+tislelizumab UTUC\n  - Sun Yat‑sen Univ, Guangzhou (3085P, 3079P) — DV combos in MIBC/NMIBC\n  - Peking Univ Cancer Hospital (3114eP) — DV+toripalimab CTC/HER2 assays\n  - Sixth Med Center of PLA (LBA7) — DV+toripalimab vs chemo (1L)\n  - Fudan Shanghai Cancer Center (3099P) — BCG proteogenomics\n  - Univ of Tsukuba, Japan (3081P) — Atezolizumab + RT bladder preservation\n  - Xi’an Jiaotong Univ (3110eP) — CEA of ctDNA‑guided atezo\n\n- Other regions:\n  - Israel (Rambam, 3105P) — Sex‑based outcomes/Nectin‑4 in EV\n  - Spain (IDISNA, 1513O) — GDF‑15 neutralization with nivolumab\n  - Turkey (Ankara Univ, 3095P) — ERBB2 mutations and EV outcomes\n\nTop KOLs (≥2 high‑impact abstracts):\n- Andrea Necchi — IRCCS San Raffaele: LBA110 (nivo+visugromab), LBA112 (TAR‑200±cetrelimab)\n- David H.

Implication: Prepare data‑driven sequencing and adverse event management narratives to sustain chemo→maintenance where appropriate.\n- Europe: Leadership in perioperative IO (durvalumab platforms), ctDNA‑guided adjuvant trials (atezo), and biomarker validation (NECTIN‑4). Implication: Engage with EU KOLs on MRD-driven frameworks and clarify where avelumab maintenance remains standard for chemo‑first.\n- Asia/China: Rapid acceleration of HER2‑targeted ADC strategies (DV + PD‑1; DV + BCG) and bladder‑preservation approaches. Implication: Anticipate global diffusion of HER2 testing and segment‑specific 1L competition; prioritize Medical Affairs readiness on HER2 assay selection and interpretation.\n- Cross‑cutting: ADC+IO backbones and MRD‑guided perioperative/adjuvant designs are converging to upstream care; this narrows downstream mUC eligible for maintenance, emphasizing the need for clear guidance on who still benefits from chemo‑first and avelumab maintenance, and what to do post‑EV."
