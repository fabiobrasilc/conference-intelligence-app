    "analysis": "# HCP Engagement Priorities: Merkel Cell at ESMO 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\n- **Top 3 Priority HCPs:**  \n  - Janice M. Mehnert (Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health) – STAMP presenter (adjuvant pembrolizumab LBA) and prior author on long‑term avelumab (JAVELIN Merkel 200) data; positioned at the intersection of adjuvant debate.  \n  - Karam Khaddour (Dana‑Farber Cancer Institute) – recent outputs on organ‑specific metastasis and patterns of distant spread; informs prognosis, surveillance and trial eligibility for metastatic MCC.  \n  - Simone Oldani (Medical Oncology Dept., Milan) – lead/author of the phase II PANDORA chemo‑immunotherapy trial design; active in first‑line combination strategies in Europe.\n- **Conference presence:** 4 HCPs tracked with 1 LBA, 0 orals, 3 posters/ePosters\n- **Geography:** US 50%, EU 25%, Asia 25%\n- **Competitor involvement:** 1 of tracked HCPs presenting competitor drug studies (adjuvant pembrolizumab, STAMP)\n- **Highest‑impact opportunity:** The LBA (STAMP) adjuvant pembrolizumab readout presented by Janice Mehnert is the single highest‑impact item at ESMO 2025 for MCC — positive STAMP results would materially shift the adjuvant landscape and directly challenge EMD’s adjuvant positioning (ADAM ongoing). Separately, the PANDORA design (Simone Oldani) is an early signal of investigator interest in chemo‑immunotherapy front‑line strategies that could shape European practice and future comparative questions versus anti‑PD‑(L)1 monotherapy.\n- **Data limitation note:** \"Co-authorship networks and historical KOL presence not assessed (single conference snapshot)\"\n\n---\n\n## 1. Priority HCP Profiles\n\n### Janice M. Mehnert – Melanoma and Cutaneous Medical Oncology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NY University, Langone Health\nSenior melanoma/cutaneous medical oncologist at NYU Langone with documented Merkel cell clinical research output, including authorship on long‑term avelumab (JAVELIN Merkel 200) data and listing on the STAMP adjuvant trial.\n\n**Conference Activity & Why They Matter:**\n- LBA56 - Proffered Paper: ECOG‑ACRIN EA6174: STAMP: Surgically Treated Adjuvant Merkel Cell Carcinoma with Pembrolizumab, a Phase III Trial. Date/Time: 10/20/2025, 09:30 - 09:40. Room: Cologne Auditorium - CityCube A.  \n  Why it matters: STAMP is a phase III adjuvant pembrolizumab trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03712605) with potential to establish pembrolizumab as an adjuvant standard. Mehnert presenting STAMP places her as a primary public voice interpreting competitor adjuvant data. Critically, Mehnert is also an author on long‑term JAVELIN Merkel 200 avelumab data (2020), giving her published, direct experience with EMD’s asset and making her influence consequential when cross‑trial comparisons and adjuvant positioning are discussed.\n\n**Latest Publications (2020-2025):**\n- (2022) The \"Great Debate\" at Melanoma Bridge 2021, December 2nd-4th, 2021.

Conference Logistics\n\nDaily Schedule Highlights (conflicts and high‑priority sessions):\n\n- 10/17/2025 14:40–15:10 — Tight sequencing of multiple proffered presentations in Dortmund Auditorium (Hall 7.1a):  \n  - 14:40–14:50: LBA109 (Enrique Grande) — DISCUS (Proffered Paper) → **Must Attend** (direct impact on avelumab 1LM eligibility/sequence).  \n  - 14:50–15:00: 3068O (Matthew D. Galsky) — CheckMate 274 5‑year adjuvant/ctDNA results (Proffered Paper) → **High Priority** (adjuvant/biomarker implications).  \n  - 15:00–15:10: LBA110 (Andrea Necchi) — GDFather‑NEO (Proffered Paper) → important for neoadjuvant IO landscape; sequential timing reduces travel risk but sequencing is tight.  \n  Recommendation (intelligence): prioritize attendance at LBA109 for direct avelumab maintenance implications; 3068O and LBA110 are high‑impact and are scheduled sequentially in the same auditorium.\n\n- 10/17/2025 16:00–16:10 — Mini oral cluster in Karlsruhe (Hall 5.2): 3069MO (Van der Heijden) 16:00–16:05, 3070MO (Drakaki) 16:05–16:10, 3071MO (Jiwei Huang) 16:35–16:40. These are short mini‑orals with minimal overlap but tight timing; plan to attend the single highest‑priority mini‑oral (NIAGARA HRQoL or FORAGER‑1 FGFR update) depending on strategic interest.\n\n- Poster session density (10/18/2025 12:00–13:00, Hall 25): Multiple competitor posters (EV cohorts, NECTIN4, AVENANCE ePosters) occur concurrently; accessible in the same room but require prioritization by strategic value (refer to Competitor Study Presenters list above).\n\nIf no additional conflicts are identified for your field team, most posters and mini‑orals are accessible during scheduled poster times. However, the 10/17 late‑afternoon sequence of proffered papers represents the clearest scheduling trade‑off for Medical Affairs coverage.\n\n---"

Mehanna (University of Birmingham) - Leads high‑profile trials in oropharyngeal cancer and authored De‑ESCALaTE analyses that directly evaluate cetuximab in curative settings.  \n  - Huaqiang Zhou (Sun Yat‑sen University Cancer Center) - Presenting LBA35: pivotal phase III data for an EGFR×HER3 ADC (BL‑B01D1) — direct EGFR‑targeting competitor to monitor.  \n  - Robert Haddad (Dana‑Farber Cancer Institute) - Active in immunotherapy combination trials and co‑author on INTERLINK‑1 (monalizumab + cetuximab), influential on cetuximab combination strategies.\n- **Conference presence:** 10 HCPs tracked with 3 LBAs, 4 orals (mini/oral), 6 posters\n- **Geography:** US 10%, EU 60%, Asia 30%\n- **Competitor involvement:** 8 of 10 tracked HCPs are presenting studies that involve competitor IO/biologic/ADC programs (durvalumab, pembrolizumab combinations, EGFR×HER3 ADC, bispecifics, etc.)\n- **Highest-impact opportunity:** Rapid intelligence capture and synthesis of LBA35 (BL‑B01D1 EGFR×HER3 ADC) plus the CompARE phase III durvalumab neoadjuvant/adjuvant readout — those two readouts most likely to change EGFR/IO dynamics relevant to cetuximab positioning. Secondary high value: monitor KOLs leading cetuximab combination trials (e.g., Haddad — INTERLINK‑1) to understand combination safety, biomarker drivers, and potential label extension implications.\n- **Data limitation note:** \"Co-authorship networks and historical KOL presence not assessed (single conference snapshot)\"\n\n---\n\n## 1. Priority HCP Profiles\n\n### Hisham M. Mehanna – Institute of Head and Neck Studies and Education, University of Birmingham\nProfessor Mehanna is a high‑visibility head and neck clinical trialist focused on HPV‑positive oropharyngeal cancer, de‑escalation strategies and health economics related to treatment choice. He is one of the most active ESMO 2025 presenters in HNC (5 items).\n\n**Conference Activity & Why They Matter:**\n- 1317O - Proffered Paper: \"Results from CompARE phase III RCT: neoadjuvant durvalumab plus chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by adjuvant durvalumab immunotherapy (IO) vs CRT alone in intermediate and high‑risk oropharyngeal cancer (OPC)\". Date/Time: 10/18/2025, 10:15–10:25. Room: Dortmund Auditorium - Hall 7.1a.  \n  Why it matters: CompARE is a Phase III neoadjuvant/adjuvant IO trial (durvalumab) in resectable/locoregional disease. A positive or practice‑changing result here will influence perioperative/definitive management paradigms and the role of EGFR‑targeted agents in curative settings; Mehanna’s leadership (and prior work comparing cisplatin vs cetuximab) means his interpretation will carry weight for guideline committees and payers.\n- Industry‑sponsored symposium roles (Welcome/Introduction; Treatment Landscape in Resectable LA HNSCC) — positions Mehanna as a visible opinion leader in resectable disease strategy.\n\n**Latest Publications (2020-2025):**\n- (2021) A cost‑utility analysis comparing CT surveillance, PET‑CT surveillance, and planned postradiation neck dissection for advanced nodal HPV‑positive oropharyngeal cancer.

Sebastian Bauer’s MOTION 2‑year vimseltinib results (2694P poster) provide the most immediate, directly comparable competitor dataset for durability and safety benchmarking against pimicotinib.\n- **Data limitation note:** \"Co-authorship networks and historical KOL presence not assessed (single conference snapshot)\"\n\n---\n\n## 1. Priority HCP Profiles\n\n### Sebastian Bauer – German Cancer Consortium, Partner Site University Hospital Essen\nSebastian Bauer is a Germany‑based clinical investigator with multiple recent publications in TGCT, including pivotal Phase 3 and real‑world registry analyses. His recent authorship of high‑visibility competitor trials positions him as a primary source for comparative evidence.\n\n**Conference Activity & Why They Matter:**\n- 2694P - Poster: Long-term efficacy and safety of vimseltinib in patients (pts) with tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT): 2-year results from the MOTION phase 3 trial. Date/Time: 10/20/2025, 12:00–13:00. Room: Hall 25. Session: Poster.\n- Why he matters: Bauer is directly associated with pivotal competitor evidence — MOTION (vimseltinib) was published in Lancet (2024) and his ESMO poster reports 2‑year outcomes. He also appears in the TGCT evidence base for pexidartinib (ENLIVEN final results, 2025). His output spans randomized Phase 3 data, registries, and consensus guidance, making him a key source for interpreting long‑term efficacy, safety signals, and real‑world management patterns that will be used to benchmark pimicotinib.\n\n**Latest Publications (2020-2025):**\n- (2025) Long-term efficacy and safety of pexidartinib in patients with tenosynovial giant cell tumor: final results of the ENLIVEN study.
