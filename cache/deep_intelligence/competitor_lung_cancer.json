Notably absent are capmatinib, telisotuzumab vedotin, or savolitinib data, suggesting limited direct head-to-head positioning versus tepotinib at this meeting’s lung cancer track. For EMD Serono, this places emphasis on defending the METex14 TKI space through diagnostic leadership (plasma CDx), durability/CNS outcomes, and RWE, while monitoring bispecific encroachment via basket strategies. Priority actions: (1) engage European KOLs around amivantamab’s basket program and its implications for MET-driven resistance segments; (2) intensify education on plasma CDx and tepotinib’s real-world outcomes/CNS profile; (3) prepare contrast narratives versus MET-directed ADCs and bispecifics for c-MET overexpression and EGFR-resistance niches ahead of broader ESMO guideline shifts.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview\n*Context current as of January 2025. Verify critical details with latest NCCN/ESMO guidelines.*\n\n### 1.1 Current Treatment Paradigm in Lung Cancer\n- Guidelines (NCCN v7.2024+; ESMO anticipated 2025 updates):\n  - Comprehensive upfront molecular profiling is standard for metastatic NSCLC, including METex14, MET amplification, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS G12C, BRAF, RET, NTRK, HER2, and PD-L1.\n  - MET-altered NSCLC subsegments:\n    - MET exon 14 skipping (METex14, ~2–3% NSCLC): selective MET TKIs are preferred (tepotinib, capmatinib) in 1L and subsequent lines.\n    - High-level MET amplification (METamp, ~1–2% in treatment-naive; higher post-TKI): managed with MET TKIs and, increasingly, MET-targeted ADCs in later lines; clinical trial participation encouraged.\n    - MET-driven acquired resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC post-osimertinib: addressed with amivantamab-based strategies ± chemotherapy, or investigational dual EGFR+MET TKI combinations (e.g., osimertinib+savolitinib).\n  - Outside MET: 1L paradigms are driver-dependent (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS G12C, RET, BRAF, NTRK, HER2) or IO-based for non-oncogene-driven disease.\n\n- Standard treatment sequence:\n  - 1L METex14: tepotinib or capmatinib; IO monotherapy is generally deprioritized due to modest benefit in METex14 despite variable PD-L1.\n  - 2L+ METex14: alternate MET TKI if not used 1L, chemo ± IO as appropriate, clinical trials, and selective use of MET-directed ADCs in MET-high settings where applicable.\n  - METamp: MET TKI or trial; consider ADCs (e.g., telisotuzumab vedotin) for c-MET IHC 3+ after prior therapy.\n  - EGFR-mutant with MET-driven resistance post-osimertinib: amivantamab-based regimens; investigational osimertinib+savolitinib.\n\n- Tepotinib (Tepmetko) positioning:\n  - NCCN-preferred for metastatic NSCLC with METex14; now supported by a plasma-based CDx enabling liquid-biopsy detection.\n  - Key differentiators to emphasize: broad CDx accessibility (plasma), durability of response, CNS activity, and real-world data supporting use in elderly/comorbid populations.\n\n### 1.2 Approved Competitive Drugs\n- Selective MET TKIs (METex14):\n  - Tepotinib (EMD Serono/Merck KGaA): FDA traditional approval (Feb 15, 2024) for metastatic NSCLC with METex14; NCCN-preferred; liquid-biopsy CDx approved (Nov 2024). EMA-approved.\n  - Capmatinib (Novartis): FDA/EMA approved for METex14 metastatic NSCLC in 1L+; class-overlapping efficacy/toxicity (notably edema, ILD risk); guideline-preferred alongside tepotinib.\n  - Savolitinib (AstraZeneca/Hutchmed): Approved in China for METex14 NSCLC; key role in combinations for EGFR-mutant MET-driven resistance (investigational outside China).\n\n- MET-directed ADCs:\n  - Telisotuzumab vedotin (AbbVie): FDA approval (Nov 27, 2024) for previously treated c-MET overexpressing (IHC 3+) NSCLC; offers a biomarker-defined ADC pathway for MET-high disease irrespective of METex14. Safety profile notable for ILD, stomatitis, cytopenias.\n\n- EGFR/MET bispecific:\n  - Amivantamab (Janssen): Approved in EGFR exon20ins and in 1L EGFR-mutant in combination with lazertinib (US, 2024); clinically addresses MET-mediated resistance via its MET-binding domain. Not labeled for METex14, but is strategically relevant for MET-driven resistance segments.\n\n- Other relevant agents/strategies:\n  - Dual EGFR+MET TKI combinations (e.g., osimertinib+savolitinib) in trials for METamp and MET-driven resistance after osimertinib; potential to erode segments where MET TKIs or ADCs could position.\n  - Crizotinib: Multi-target TKI with MET activity; not approved for METex14 and largely supplanted by selective MET TKIs.\n\n### 1.3 EMD Serono's Competitive Position\n- Comparative profile:\n  - Tepotinib vs capmatinib: Similar class efficacy in METex14 with meaningful ORR and DOR; edema is a class AE. Differentiators for tepotinib include a validated plasma CDx pathway and emerging CNS/RWE support.\n  - Versus telisotuzumab vedotin: Different biomarker segment (IHC 3+ overexpression). ADCs may siphon later-line patients with MET-high disease regardless of genotype; toxicity profile differs (ILD/stomatitis), creating trade-offs.\n  - Versus amivantamab strategies: Primarily targets EGFR-driven populations; however, it competes for EGFR-mutant patients with MET-driven resistance and could encroach on METamp niches via chemo/bispecific regimens.\n\n- Key clinical differentiators to reinforce:\n  - Liquid-biopsy CDx enabling rapid identification and treatment initiation in frail/elderly patients.\n  - Durability of response and potential CNS activity data points (where available) vs class peers.\n  - Real-world effectiveness and tolerability profile, including edema management best practices and dose optimization.\n\n- Main competitive threats:\n  - Fragmentation of MET-altered NSCLC into micro-niches (METex14 vs METamp vs MET IHC 3+) enabling non-TKI competitors (ADCs, bispecifics).\n  - Growing amivantamab-based strategies for MET-driven resistance in EGFR-mutant disease that could decrease second-line TKI utilization.\n  - Payer and diagnostic gatekeeping: uptake of plasma NGS and IHC testing patterns will shape funnel sizes for TKIs vs ADCs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. ESMO 2025 Competitor Activity Analysis\n\n### 2.1 Competitor Presentation Volume and Focus\nAt ESMO 2025, the most prominent competitor regimens by presentation volume were:\n1. Amivantamab: 1 study\n\n1. Amivantamab (Count: 1 study)\n   - MOA Class: EGFR/MET bispecific antibody\n   - Development Phase: Basket/Translational (Poster)\n   - Key Abstracts: 932P\n   - Brief note: Early cross-tumor MET/EGFR aberration data; signals positioning beyond EGFR-only settings\n\nAnalysis:\n- MOA dominance: Bispecific antibody (EGFR/MET) is the lone MET-relevant entrant in the curated set; no selective MET TKI or MET-ADC presentations identified.\n- New entrants: None detected for METex14 in this dataset; absence of capmatinib/telisotuzumab vedotin/savolitinib signals limited direct TKI/ADC competition at this meeting’s lung track materials.\n- Evidence types: The included amivantamab study is basket-style, supporting a tumor-agnostic aberration strategy and broad KOL engagement.\n- Strategic implications for EMD:\n  - Reinforce METex14 TKI leadership (NCCN-preferred) amid minimal direct conference activity.\n  - Prepare cross-asset narratives versus amivantamab in MET-driven resistance segments (EGFR-mutant), emphasizing tepotinib’s role in true METex14 and the importance of precision diagnostics to allocate patients correctly.\n  - Leverage the vacuum in METex14 visibility to push plasma CDx adoption and RWE messaging.\n\n### 2.2 High-Priority Competitor Studies\n1. 932P Amivantamab — Amivantamab in subjects with aberrant MET and/or EGFR solid tumors (Baskets of Baskets)\n   - Investigators: Richard F. Schlenk — NCT Heidelberg (Germany)\n   - Session: 10/19/2025 — Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: This basket, focused on MET and/or EGFR aberrations, underscores Janssen’s strategy to extend amivantamab across biomarker-defined niches, including MET-driven resistance contexts. For EMD, this highlights a need to defend METex14 as a distinct genotype-driven space requiring selective MET TKIs, while monitoring amivantamab’s data trajectory in METamp and post-osimertinib resistance cohorts where bispecifics may compete with MET TKIs or MET-ADC approaches.\n\n### 2.3 Emerging Threats and Novel Approaches\n[Not included due to limited MET-competitive activity (1 study).]\n\n### 2.4 Geographic and Institutional Patterns\n- Geographic Distribution:\n  - United States:\n    - Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston): Targeted therapy expertise; potential cross-talk on resistance biology.\n  - Europe:\n    - NCT Heidelberg (Germany): Amivantamab basket poster; key hub for EGFR/MET bispecific development.\n    - Barcelona (Spain) institutions (VHIR, IMIM/Hospital del Mar, Hospital Clínic): Strong translational/biomarker presence; potential partners for diagnostics/RWE.\n    - UK (Aberystwyth University): Real-world data infrastructure—useful for RWE collaborations.\n  - Asia/China:\n    - Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (Tongji Univ.): Early-phase targeted programs; potential rapid adoption of novel targeted/bispecific regimens.\n    - JFCR (Tokyo): First-in-human targeted studies; experienced in precision oncology trial operations.\n    - Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Hangzhou (China): Active in early-phase IO/targeted modalities; potential sites for MET combo exploration.\n\n- Top KOLs (≥2 high-impact abstracts):\n  - None identified in this dataset (no investigator appears on ≥2 high-impact MET-relevant abstracts).\n\n- Regional Patterns and Insights:\n  - Europe shows visible leadership in amivantamab’s cross-tumor exploration (NCT Heidelberg), reinforcing a need for proactive engagement in EU centers with EGFR/MET bispecific expertise.\n  - Spain’s translational groups are highly active in biomarker science—opportunity to expand plasma CDx utilization studies for METex14.\n  - China and Japan continue to drive early-phase targeted innovation; watch for rapid pivot into MET combinations or basket expansions that could enter global development.\n  - Strategic implications: Prioritize EU engagement around bispecific narratives; expand diagnostic partnerships in Spain to accelerate METex14 identification; maintain Asia-Pacific intelligence coverage for early MET combination signals that could prefigure global trials."
