# AI Reasoning Transparency - Demo

## Your Question: "Show AI reasoning to user?"

**My Answer:** Yes! But show it IN the response, not as a delay before execution.

**Implementation:** AI response now STARTS by confirming what it understood.

## Example 1: "EV + P"

### What Happens Behind the Scenes:

**Step 1 - AI Keyword Extraction:**
```json
{
    "drugs": ["enfortumab vedotin", "pembrolizumab"],
    "search_terms": ["combination"]
}
```

**Step 2 - DataFrame Filtering:**
- 4,686 → 16 (enfortumab vedotin)
- 16 → 11 (+ pembrolizumab)

**Step 3 - AI Analysis Prompt Includes:**
> "**What I Understood:** Studies about **enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab**"

### What User Sees:

```
I found 11 studies about the **enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab** combination.

Here's what's being presented:

**Bladder Cancer - First-Line Treatment:**
- LBA2: Phase III EV-302 comparing EV+P vs platinum chemo in...
- 3094P: Real-world outcomes of first-line EV+P in...
...

**Bladder Cancer - Perioperative:**
- 3089P: Neoadjuvant EV+P in cisplatin-ineligible...
...
```

**User immediately sees:**
1. ✅ AI understood the abbreviations correctly
2. ✅ Found 11 studies (can verify count)
3. ✅ Can correct if wrong interpretation

## Example 2: "I am curious about the studies being presented on 10/18 about nivolumab in renal cancer."

### What Happens Behind the Scenes:

**Step 1 - AI Keyword Extraction:**
```json
{
    "drugs": ["nivolumab"],
    "therapeutic_areas": ["renal cancer", "renal cell carcinoma"],
    "dates": ["10/18"]
}
```

**Step 2 - DataFrame Filtering:**
- 4,686 → 1,431 (10/18)
- 1,431 → 18 (nivolumab)
- 18 → 6 (renal cancer)

**Step 3 - AI Analysis Prompt Includes:**
> "**What I Understood:** Studies on **10/18** about **nivolumab** in **renal cancer, renal cell carcinoma**"

### What User Sees:

```
I found 6 studies on **10/18** about **nivolumab** in **renal cell carcinoma**.

Here's what's being presented:

**Morning Proffered Oral (High Priority):**
- 2591O (08:50-09:00): Efficacy of Cabozantinib and Nivolumab in Cluster 1/2
  mccRCC - Results from OPTIC RCC phase II trial with RNAseq biomarker

**Poster Session (12:00-13:00):**
- 2624P: AI-powered immune phenotype predicts differential benefit from
  NIVO+IPI vs sunitinib in advanced ccRCC
- 2626P: CaboCombo real-world study - second interim analysis of
  cabozantinib + nivolumab as first-line treatment
...

**Practical Note:** The proffered oral (2591O) is likely the highest-impact
presentation. Five posters run concurrently at 12:00, so you'll need to prioritize.
```

**User immediately sees:**
1. ✅ AI understood: 10/18 + nivolumab + renal cancer
2. ✅ Found 6 studies (matches manual verification!)
3. ✅ Bonus: AI prioritized by session type (oral vs poster)

## Example 3: "What's MD Anderson presenting?"

### What Happens Behind the Scenes:

**Step 1 - AI Keyword Extraction:**
```json
{
    "institutions": ["MD Anderson", "MD Anderson Cancer Center"],
    "search_terms": ["presentation"]
}
```

**Step 2 - DataFrame Filtering:**
- 4,686 → 73 (MD Anderson in affiliations)

**Step 3 - AI Analysis Prompt Includes:**
> "**What I Understood:** Studies from **MD Anderson, MD Anderson Cancer Center**"

### What User Sees:

```
I found 73 studies from **MD Anderson Cancer Center**.

Here's a summary by therapeutic area:

**Genitourinary Cancers (24 studies):**
- Bladder: 8 presentations including...
- Prostate: 11 presentations featuring...
- Renal: 5 presentations on...

**Lung Cancer (18 studies):**
...

**Top 5 High-Impact Presentations:**
1. LBA15 (Main Session): Phase III...
2. 2591O (Proffered Oral): OPTIC RCC biomarker...
...

Would you like me to focus on a specific therapeutic area or session type?
```

**User immediately sees:**
1. ✅ AI understood: MD Anderson institution filter
2. ✅ Found 73 studies (correct!)
3. ✅ AI organized by TA for easy navigation
4. ✅ Proactive offer to drill down

## Why This Approach Works

### ✅ No Delay
- User doesn't wait for clarification
- Response starts streaming immediately
- First sentence shows understanding

### ✅ Transparency Without Friction
- User sees what AI interpreted in context
- Can immediately spot errors ("Wait, I meant PD-1, not PD-L1")
- Natural language, not technical JSON

### ✅ Self-Correcting
If user asks: "EV in breast cancer"

And AI responds: "I found 3 studies about **enfortumab vedotin** in **breast cancer**..."

User sees: "Wait, there shouldn't be any EV in breast cancer - it's a bladder cancer drug!"

→ User can immediately follow up: "Actually, show me ADC studies in breast cancer"

---

## When Would You Ask Clarifying Questions?

**Scenario 1 - Truly Ambiguous:**
```
User: "Show me EV studies"

AI: "I found 145 studies. Did you mean:
- Enfortumab vedotin (EV, an ADC for bladder cancer)
- Extracellular vesicles (EV, used in biomarker research)
- EV-302 trial specifically?"
```

**Scenario 2 - Zero Results:**
```
User: "Pembrolizumab in prostate cancer"

AI: "I found 0 studies about **pembrolizumab** in **prostate cancer**
at this conference.

This is unusual - pembrolizumab is typically used in other tumor types.
Did you mean:
- Pembrolizumab in bladder/kidney cancer (23 studies)?
- Other immunotherapy in prostate cancer (41 studies)?"
```

**Scenario 3 - Conflicting Filters:**
```
User has TA filter: "Lung Cancer" active
User asks: "Show me Bavencio studies"

AI: "I found 0 studies - Bavencio (bladder cancer drug) with Lung Cancer
filter active. Would you like me to:
- Remove TA filter and show all Bavencio studies (15)?
- Show PD-L1 inhibitors in lung cancer instead (67)?"
```

## Configuration Knob Idea

In ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md, you could add:

```markdown
## AI Behavior Settings

**Clarification Threshold:**
- `transparent` (default): Show understanding in response, don't ask
- `cautious`: Ask before executing if ambiguous or zero results
- `aggressive`: Always ask for confirmation (medical safety critical apps)

**Transparency Level:**
- `full`: "I found 6 studies on **10/18** about **nivolumab** in **RCC**..."
- `minimal`: Just provide analysis (current behavior before this change)
- `debug`: Show extracted keywords + reasoning in response
```

---

## Summary

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ AI shows what it understood as the FIRST LINE of response
- ✅ User sees interpretation immediately without delay
- ✅ Natural language, embedded in analysis
- ✅ User can course-correct on next query if needed

**When to ask clarifying questions:**
- True ambiguity (EV = drug or biomarker?)
- Zero results (probably misunderstood)
- Conflicting filters (UI filter vs query don't match)

**Philosophy:**
> "Show the user what you're thinking, but don't make them wait for it."
