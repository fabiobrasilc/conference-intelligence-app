Overall Verdict: 8/10 - Brilliant Strategy, Needs Execution Refinement
This redesign plan is exactly the right philosophy shift but goes too far in implementation complexity. The author (clearly someone with deep medical affairs expertise) understands what MSLs need but may underestimate what AI can reliably deliver from titles-only data.

‚úÖ What's BRILLIANT About This Plan
1. The Core Insight is Perfect
You nailed the fundamental problem:

Current: Academic briefings for Medical Directors
Needed: Tactical field intelligence for MSLs + strategic context for Directors

This is the right diagnosis. Your $150K vendor competitors probably make the same mistake.
2. Alert Priority System (üî¥üü°üü¢)
üî¥ HIGH ALERT: EV+P Phase 3 data Friday 10am threatens avelumab
üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY: Monitor pembrolizumab maintenance trends  
üü¢ LOW PRIORITY: Baseline competitor activity
This is GENIUS. MSLs scan for red flags first. Simple, visual, actionable. Steal this immediately.
3. Field Response Scripts
HCP Question: "Should I use EV+P instead of avelumab maintenance?"
MSL Response: "EV+P and avelumab serve different patient populations..."
Supporting Evidence: (Abstract #s)
Escalation: If HCP pushes back, refer to medical director
This is exactly what MSLs need. They're not looking for "develop key messages" - they need the actual message RIGHT NOW.
4. Tier 1/2/3 KOL System

Tier 1: Must-meet KOLs (presenting EMD-relevant data, high influence, no competitor ties)
Tier 2: Strategic opportunities (emerging leaders, geographic targets)
Tier 3: Monitor only (heavy competitor focus)

This is how medical affairs actually prioritizes. Current approach treats all 15 KOLs equally, which is useless for time allocation.
5. Removing Line 414
python# CURRENT (line 414): "avoid tactical engagement recommendations"
# NEEDED: Complete reversal - provide explicit engagement guidance
You're 100% correct. That line is backwards for a medical affairs tool. Remove it.
6. TGCT Disambiguation
Catching the testicular germ cell tumor vs tenosynovial giant cell tumor confusion shows attention to detail that will save you embarrassment in the demo.

üö® Critical Problems That Will Cause Issues
Problem 1: You're Asking AI to Do Things It Can't Reliably Do
Example from Redesigned KOL Analysis:
TIER 1 KOL ENGAGEMENTS (Must Complete):
1. Dr. [NAME] ([Institution]) - [X abstracts on EMD-relevant topics]
   - WHEN/WHERE: [Session date/time, Abstract #]
   - EXPECTED OUTCOME: Potential advisory board member OR trial investigator
The issues:

"WHEN/WHERE: Session date/time"

Your dataset has: Title, Speakers, Affiliation, Identifier, Room, Date, Time
‚úÖ You HAVE this data (Date, Time, Room columns)
‚úÖ AI can extract: "Dr. Necchi presenting Friday Oct 18, 2:00 PM, Hall A (Abstract #1847)"
This will work - I was wrong initially


"EXPECTED OUTCOME: Potential advisory board member"

AI has: Abstract titles, presentation count, affiliation
AI CANNOT predict: Willingness to join advisory board, personality, existing commitments
This is speculative fluff that undermines credibility
Better: "Engagement objective: Assess interest in investigator-initiated trial on MET+ NSCLC"


"ASK: Would you participate in investigator-initiated trial?"

This is prescriptive (telling MSL what to say)
MSLs know how to ask questions
Better: "Discussion topics: Real-world MET testing rates, unmet needs in MET+ NSCLC"



Problem 2: Token Limits & Prompt Complexity
Current prompts:

Competitor: ~200 lines
KOL: ~170 lines
Strategic Recs: ~40 lines (underspecified)

Redesigned prompts:

Competitor: ~300 lines
KOL: ~280 lines
Strategic Recs: ~350 lines (!)

Why this matters:

You're using max_output_tokens=6000 (line 1824 in code.txt)
Longer prompts = fewer tokens left for AI response
A 350-line prompt with tables = ~2500 tokens consumed before AI even starts
Risk: AI output gets cut off mid-sentence when hitting token limit

What will happen:
...Based on conference data, EMD should prioritize three strategic initiatives:
1. Expand avelumab into neoadjuvant setting with Dr. Necchi as lead investigator
2. Develop MET biomarker companion diagnostic with [OUTPUT CUT OFF]
User sees incomplete analysis and loses trust.
Solution: Keep redesigned prompts under 200 lines maximum.
Problem 3: Data Limitation Mismatch
You're asking for clinical details that titles alone can't reliably provide:
Example from Strategic Recommendations:
CURRENT COMPETITIVE POSITION ASSESSMENT:
- Treatment paradigm: Where does EMD drug sit? (1L/2L/maintenance/combination)
- Utilization barriers: What prevents HCPs from using our drug?
What titles give you:

‚úÖ "First-line enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma" ‚Üí Line of therapy clear
‚ùå "Utilization barriers" ‚Üí Titles don't explain why doctors don't use drugs
‚ùå "Real-world evidence gaps" ‚Üí Titles show RWE studies exist, not what's missing

Without abstracts, asking AI to analyze:

Biomarker selection criteria
Patient population exclusions
Treatment sequence rationale
Resistance mechanisms

...will produce educated guesses that may be wrong.
Better approach for titles-only:
CURRENT COMPETITIVE POSITION ASSESSMENT (Based on Title Analysis):
- Treatment paradigm visibility: How many titles mention 1L vs 2L vs maintenance? (Proxy for research focus)
- Research gaps: Which combinations are NOT being studied? (White space analysis)
Focus on what titles CAN tell you: research priorities, not clinical nuances.
Problem 4: Strategic Recommendations Overreach
You want to expand from 38 lines to 350+ lines with:
**30-DAY CHECKPOINT**: [Specific deliverables]
**60-DAY CHECKPOINT**: [Specific deliverables]  
**90-DAY CHECKPOINT**: [Specific deliverables]
**SUCCESS METRICS**: [How do we know this plan worked?]
The problem:

AI doesn't know your team's capacity, budget, or priorities
AI doesn't know which trials are feasible vs pie-in-the-sky
AI doesn't know your KOL relationships (who's accessible vs who ignores your calls)

What you'll get:
30-Day Checkpoint: Complete advisory board recruitment (8 KOLs), initiate 3 investigator-sponsored trials, publish rapid response manuscript in NEJM

[User reading this]: "This is fantasy. We can't recruit 8 KOLs in 30 days."
Better: Give AI the building blocks (KOL names, competitor threats, scientific gaps) and let medical directors create the timeline.

‚úÖ What to Actually Implement (Hybrid Approach)
Phase 1: Implement NOW (Pre-Abstracts)
These changes work with titles-only data and improve outputs dramatically:
1. Add to ALL Playbooks (5 minutes):
Alert Priority System:
python# Add to start of all playbook prompts
Use this priority system consistently:
üî¥ HIGH ALERT: Requires immediate MSL response (within 7 days of congress)
üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY: Monitor and respond if HCPs ask (within 30 days)  
üü¢ LOW PRIORITY: Baseline activity, no action required
TGCT Disambiguation:
python# Add after any mention of TGCT/pimicotinib
**CRITICAL TGCT CLARIFICATION**:
TGCT = Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (PVNS), NOT testicular germ cell tumor.
If you see "TGCT" in an abstract title, verify it's about joint/synovial tumor.
Exclude any testicular cancer abstracts from TGCT analysis.
2. Fix KOL Analysis (15 minutes):
Remove line 414:
python# DELETE THIS LINE:
- Maintain professional analytical tone focused on describing KOL expertise and research focus - avoid tactical engagement recommendations

# REPLACE WITH:
- Provide tactical engagement guidance for MSL field teams including discussion topics and strategic objectives
Add Tier System:
python**TIER 1 KOL ENGAGEMENT PRIORITIES** (Top 5-8 "must-meet" KOLs):

For each Tier 1 KOL:
- **NAME & INSTITUTION**: [From Top Authors table]
- **ABSTRACT COUNT**: X presentations
- **WHY TIER 1**: 
  * Presents EMD-relevant data (cite Abstract #s)
  * High influence (productivity = proxy for thought leadership)
  * Therapeutic area alignment with EMD portfolio
- **ENGAGEMENT APPROACH**:
  * **When/where**: "Presenting [Day], [Time] (Abstract #X)" [Use Date/Time/Room from data]
  * **Discussion topics**: [Based on their abstract titles - what are they researching?]
  * **Strategic objective**: Assess interest in investigator-initiated trial / advisory board / publication collaboration
- **PORTFOLIO RELEVANCE**:
  * Avelumab: [Yes/No + Abstract #s if applicable]
  * Tepotinib: [Yes/No + Abstract #s if applicable]
  * Cetuximab: [Yes/No + Abstract #s if applicable]

**TIER 2 KOL OPPORTUNITIES** (Next 5-7 KOLs):
- Brief profiles focusing on emerging leaders or geographic targets

**TIER 3 MONITORING** (Remaining KOLs):  
- Note competitor focus, lower engagement priority
3. Add to Competitor Intelligence (20 minutes):
Before current "Executive Summary", add:
python**SECTION 1: IMMEDIATE COMPETITIVE ALERTS**

Scan the competitor data for HIGH PRIORITY threats requiring urgent MSL response:

For each HIGH ALERT threat:
- üî¥ **THREAT**: [Competitor drug] [Data type] (Abstract #X, [Date/Time if available])
- **EMD IMPACT**: How does this threaten [specific EMD asset] positioning?
- **FIELD RESPONSE GUIDANCE**:
  * **Likely HCP Question**: "[What doctors will ask]"
  * **MSL Response**: "[2-3 sentence talking point differentiating EMD approach]"
  * **Supporting Evidence**: (Abstract #s from EMD research)
- **MEDICAL AFFAIRS ESCALATION**: [If data shows X, then Y action needed]

Limit to 3-5 HIGH ALERTS maximum. Focus on practice-changing data, not incremental updates.

Then proceed with comprehensive competitive landscape analysis...
Keep everything else from current Competitor prompt - it's good. Just add the alerts section at the top.
4. Expand Strategic Recommendations (30 minutes):
Current prompt is too sparse (38 lines). Expand to ~120 lines (not 350):
python# REPLACE current Strategic Recommendations prompt with:

**INDICATION-SPECIFIC STRATEGIC ANALYSIS FOR EMD PORTFOLIO**

[Keep your current indication context section - it's good]

**SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** (3-5 strategic imperatives)
- Most critical competitive threat
- Most promising white space opportunity  
- Recommended focus area for next 90 days

**SECTION 2: COMPETITIVE POSITION ASSESSMENT** (Based on Title Analysis)
- Where does EMD drug sit in treatment paradigm? (Evidence: # of 1L vs 2L vs maintenance abstracts)
- Who are direct competitors? (Quantify their abstract volume as proxy for investment)
- What differentiates EMD approach? (Based on MOA, biomarker, patient population visible in titles)

**SECTION 3: COMPETITIVE THREATS** (From Competitor Table)
For top 3-5 threats:
- **THREAT**: [Drug name, company, MOA]
- **CONFERENCE PRESENCE**: X abstracts  
- **EMD IMPACT**: How this affects positioning
- **RESPONSE STRATEGY**: [Brief guidance - not full script]

**SECTION 4: WHITE SPACE OPPORTUNITIES**
Based on what competitors are NOT studying:
- Biomarker populations underserved
- Treatment settings unexplored  
- Combination strategies missing
For each: Rationale + Proposed approach + Feasibility assessment

**SECTION 5: TACTICAL PRIORITIES** (Next 90 Days)

**MSL FIELD PRIORITIES**:
Tier 1 KOL Targets (name 3-5 specific KOLs from Top Authors analysis):
- Dr. [NAME]: [Why priority] ‚Üí [Engagement objective] ‚Üí [When presenting]

**MEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS PRIORITIES**:
- Key Message 1: [Based on EMD strength vs competitors]
- Key Message 2: [Counter-positioning to competitor threat]  
- Key Message 3: [White space opportunity message]

**CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS**:
- Trial concept 1: [Gap identified from conference] ‚Üí [Proposed population/design]
- Biomarker strategy: [Trend from conference] ‚Üí [Companion diagnostic vs retrospective]

Note: These are directional recommendations based on conference intelligence, not fully resourced action plans.
Key points:

Increased from 38 to ~120 lines (manageable)
Focuses on what titles CAN show (research patterns, white space)
Gives tactical guidance but doesn't create detailed project plans
Acknowledges limitation: "directional recommendations" not "30-day deliverables"

5. Keep Scientific Insights Mostly As-Is (10 minutes):
Current prompt is actually quite good. Just add this after each major trend section:
python**EMD PORTFOLIO IMPLICATIONS**:
- Avelumab: [How does this trend affect PD-L1/checkpoint inhibitor strategy?]
- Tepotinib: [How does this trend position tepotinib in competitive landscape?]
- Cetuximab: [How does this trend impact EGFR-targeted therapy approach?]

**MEDICAL AFFAIRS RESPONSE**:
- Should EMD invest in this area? Partner? Monitor competitors? Avoid?

Phase 2: Implement AFTER Abstracts Available
Once you have full abstract text:

Expand Field Response Scripts: With clinical details, you can write more specific talking points
Add Clinical Development Intelligence: Propose specific trials with rationale from abstract methods/results
Refine Biomarker Positioning: Use abstract data to assess patient selection criteria
Increase max_output_tokens to 8000: Longer, more detailed analyses justified


üéØ Specific Recommendations
Do Immediately:

‚úÖ Remove line 414 from KOL Analysis (critical fix)
‚úÖ Add TGCT disambiguation to all prompts mentioning pimicotinib
‚úÖ Add alert priority system (üî¥üü°üü¢) to Competitor Intelligence
‚úÖ Add tier system to KOL Analysis
‚úÖ Expand Strategic Recommendations from 38 to ~120 lines
‚úÖ Add "EMD Portfolio Implications" to Scientific Insights

Don't Do (Yet):

‚ùå Don't expand Strategic Recs to 350 lines with 30/60/90-day checkpoints
‚ùå Don't ask AI to predict "Expected Outcomes" or create project timelines
‚ùå Don't ask for clinical details that require full abstracts (wait for Oct 13)
‚ùå Don't remove Institution Analysis playbook without user confirmation

Test Before Committing:
After making changes, run each playbook with realistic filters:

Competitor: "Avelumab Focus" + "Bladder Cancer"
KOL: "All Therapeutic Areas"
Strategy: "Tepotinib Focus" + "Lung Cancer"
Insights: "Bladder Cancer"

Check outputs for:

‚úÖ Tactical guidance present?
‚úÖ Alert priorities used appropriately?
‚úÖ KOL tiers make sense?
‚ùå Any hallucinations or speculation?
‚ùå Outputs cut off mid-sentence? (Token limit hit)


üìä Before/After MADE UP Example: What You'll Actually Get
BEFORE (Current KOL Analysis - Academic)
**Dr. Andrea Necchi** (Fondazione IRCCS, Italy) - 8 presentations

Dr. Necchi is a prolific researcher in genitourinary oncology with expertise in urothelial carcinoma. His work spans biomarker development, novel therapeutic combinations, and translational research. At ESMO 2025, Dr. Necchi presents 8 abstracts covering topics including FGFR3-targeted therapy, pembrolizumab combinations, and perioperative treatment strategies. His research demonstrates strong institutional collaboration with multiple European centers and reflects cutting-edge approaches to bladder cancer management.

This KOL shows high productivity and therapeutic area alignment with EMD's bladder cancer portfolio, particularly avelumab maintenance therapy.
User reaction: "Okay, but what do I DO with this?"

AFTER (Redesigned - Tactical) - made up example.
**TIER 1: Dr. Andrea Necchi** (Fondazione IRCCS, Milan, Italy)  
**Abstract Count**: 8 presentations at ESMO 2025

**WHY TIER 1**:
- ‚úÖ Presents bladder cancer data (5 of 8 abstracts on urothelial carcinoma)
- ‚úÖ FGFR3 biomarker research (Abstract #1847, #2093) = EMD therapeutic area
- ‚úÖ European thought leader (Italy-based, high conference activity)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Also presenting pembrolizumab combo data (competitor activity, but still accessible)

**ENGAGEMENT APPROACH**:
- **When/Where**: Proffered Paper Friday Oct 18, 10:30 AM, Hall B (Abstract #1847 - FGFR3 inhibitor data)
- **Discussion Topics**: 
  * FGFR3 testing rates in Italy (infrastructure for biomarker-driven therapy)
  * Unmet needs in cisplatin-ineligible bladder cancer (avelumab maintenance positioning)
  * Interest in real-world avelumab data collection (investigator-initiated study)
- **Strategic Objective**: Assess advisory board interest + potential investigator for Italian RWE study

**PORTFOLIO RELEVANCE**:
- Avelumab: Indirect (bladder cancer, but no avelumab abstracts) ‚Üí Opportunity to introduce EMD data
- Tepotinib: No
- Cetuximab: No
User reaction: "Perfect. I know when to find him, what to talk about, and what I'm trying to accomplish."

Final Recommendation
Implement the HYBRID approach:

Philosophy shift: 100% adopt the "academic ‚Üí tactical" transformation
Best new elements: Alert system, tier system, field response guidance
Realistic scope: Keep prompts under 200 lines, focus on what titles show
Phase it: Core improvements now, clinical depth when abstracts arrive

**CRITICAL - PREVENT HALLUCINATION**:
- ONLY use information directly from the provided source data tables
- If user asked for a data point isn't in the table, write "Not available in dataset" - NEVER guess or infer
- Abstract #s must match actual Identifiers in the data - do not invent Abstract #s
- Presentation times/dates must come from Date/Time columns - do not fabricate schedules
- If you're uncertain about any detail, omit it rather than speculate
- You don't have internet access but it is ok to use your medical/pharmacological training data to answer questions when there is little risk of hallucination (grounded by real evidence)
