    "analysis": "# HCP Engagement Priorities: Merkel Cell at ESMO 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\n- **Top 3 Priority HCPs:**  \n  - Janice M. Mehnert (Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health) - STAMP phase III presenter (adjuvant pembrolizumab) and prior author on JAVELIN Merkel 200 avelumab long-term data. High impact on adjuvant standard-setting.  \n  - Karam Khaddour (Dana‑Farber Cancer Institute) - active clinical/real-world research on metastasis patterns and survival; informs imaging/surveillance and sequencing decisions relevant to immunotherapy attrition.  \n  - Simone Oldani (Milan) - PI/leader on first-line chemo‑immunotherapy PANDORA design; may shift first-line combination paradigms if positive.\n- **Conference presence:** 3 HCPs tracked with 1 LBA, 0 orals, 2 poster-format presentations (poster + ePoster).\n- **Geography:** US 67%, EU 33%, Asia 0%\n- **Competitor involvement:** 1 of tracked HCPs presenting a competitor drug study (pembrolizumab, STAMP)\n- **Highest-impact opportunity:** The STAMP LBA (adjuvant pembrolizumab) is a potential practice-changing data point that directly affects EMD’s avelumab positioning in adjuvant MCC; engaging the STAMP presenter(s) and authors to understand subgroup and biomarker analyses is high value. Secondary high-value signal: PANDORA (chemo‑immunotherapy) could alter first-line combination expectations in advanced disease.\n- **Data limitation note:** \"Co-authorship networks and historical KOL presence not assessed (single conference snapshot)\"\n\n---\n\n## 1. Priority HCP Profiles\n\n### Janice M. Mehnert – Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health\nSenior clinician‑scientist in melanoma and cutaneous oncology with demonstrated translational and clinical focus in MCC and immunotherapy.\n\n**Conference Activity & Why They Matter:**\n- LBA56 - Proffered Paper: \"ECOG-ACRIN EA6174: STAMP: Surgically Treated Adjuvant Merkel Cell Carcinoma with Pembrolizumab, a Phase III Trial.\" Date/Time: 10/20/2025, 09:30–09:40.
