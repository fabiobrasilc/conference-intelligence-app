    "analysis": "# Strategic Briefing — Tepotinib (Tepmetko) | Lung Cancer — ESMO 2025\n\n## Executive summary — Page 1 (TL;DR)\n1) What happened at ESMO (top 3 takeaways)\n- MET biology at ESMO 2025 was presented as three operationally distinct clinical pathways:  \n  - METex14 (oncogenic driver) — reinforced by long‑term tepotinib (VISION) durability and intracranial activity (1996P,1995P,1998P).  \n  - MET amplification/overexpression as an acquired resistance mechanism in EGFRm disease — addressed by EGFR+MET combinations (savolitinib + osimertinib; SAVANNAH 1958P) and ctDNA monitoring (SACHI ctDNA analysis 1954P).  \n  - MET protein overexpression (IHC) — targeted by ADCs (telisotuzumab vedotin/LUMINOSITY 1948P/1951P/1950P) with an implementable CDx (VENTANA MET SP44).\n- Diagnostics and biomarkers moved toward operational use: ctDNA early‑response clearance correlated with PFS for MET‑combination strategies (1954P); validated IHC CDx for ADC selection was presented (1951P). Bispecifics (amivantamab) advanced operationally (SC formulation, prophylaxis strategies) and ADCs refined toxicity‑management pathways.\n- Practical consequence: tepotinib’s position as the METex14 TKI is strengthened by durability and CNS signals, but uptake and sequencing are threatened by (a) ADCs that capture MET‑OE (IHC) populations with a validated CDx, and (b) EGFR+MET combinations/bispecifics that dominate the METamp (post‑osimertinib) niche. ctDNA is emerging as a near‑term decision tool.\n\n2) How this affects Tepotinib (honest assessment)\n- Strengthened: VISION 3‑year follow‑up (1996P/1995P) provides a clear durability and intracranial efficacy message to defend METex14 leadership (ORR T+ 54.8%, mDOR 17.4 mo; 1L T+ mDOR 31.7 mo). REAL‑MET (1998P) confirms intracranial responses in routine practice.\n- Threatened: ADCs (telisotuzumab vedotin) with a validated IHC CDx and EGFR+MET combos (savolitinib+osimertinib; amivantamab combos) create parallel pathways that can fragment patient flow and limit tepotinib uptake — especially where testing favors IHC over NGS/plasma or where METamp after osimertinib is the clinical problem.\n- Net: Defend METex14 via diagnostic capture (plasma + tissue NGS), emphasize durability/CNS benefit, and fill sequencing and ctDNA evidence gaps.\n\n3) Immediate strategic posture (one‑line asks)\n- MSLs: Lead with VISION 3‑year durability + intracranial data; ensure pathologists and tumor‑boards use RNA/NGS or plasma CDx to identify METex14. (See Immediate Actions, page 2.)\n- Medical Affairs: Start a focused RWE registry + ctDNA substudy and convene a MET sequencing advisory board (top KOLs) within 8 weeks.  \n- HQ Leadership: Fund diagnostic adoption (plasma CDx roll‑out), approve RWE budget, and prioritize a CNS‑focused feasibility study to support label maintenance/expansion.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate actions — Page 2 (0–3 months)\n(Front‑loaded, role‑specific, highly actionable)\n\n### MSLs / Field Medical — this week\nKey messages (one‑liners to use in HCP conversations; cite study ID)\n- \"Tepotinib is the evidence‑backed METex14 TKI with 3‑year VISION durability and CNS activity — tissue‑positive ORR 54.8%, mDOR 17.4 mo; 1L T+ mDOR 31.7 mo (VISION 1996P/1995P).\"  \n- \"Tepotinib shows meaningful intracranial responses in trial and real world (VISION + REAL‑MET; intracranial ORR up to ~67% in evaluable REAL‑MET patients) — consider early MET testing if brain mets present (1996P,1998P).\"  \n- \"MET testing matters: METex14 is best detected by RNA‑aware NGS or a validated plasma CDx; c‑MET IHC (SP44) selects for ADCs (telisotuzumab vedotin) — clarify biomarker (genomic vs protein) before choosing therapy (1951P,1948P).\"\n\nObjection handling (top anticipated questions + short answers)\n- Q: \"Why not start telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso‑V) instead of tepotinib?\"  \n  A: Teliso‑V is targeted at c‑MET IHC‑high (protein overexpression); tepotinib targets METex14 genomic drivers. Teliso‑V has meaningful ORR (~29–34%) but ADC‑class neuropathy/ocular AEs and lacks the long‑term durability/CNS dataset we have with VISION (1948P,1951P vs 1996P). Selection depends on biomarker (IHC vs METex14 NGS/plasma).\n- Q: \"What about osimertinib + savolitinib in MET amplification after osimertinib?\"  \n  A: SAVANNAH/SACHI ctDNA data show faster molecular clearance and improved PFS vs chemo for METamp post‑EGFR TKI, but the combination has predictable AESIs (edema, VTE, hepatotoxicity) requiring proactive AE management (1958P,1954P). Tepotinib is currently positioned for METex14 — different niche.\n- Q: \"Does tepotinib control brain mets?\"  \n  A: Yes — VISION long‑term data + REAL‑MET show intracranial responses. However, patients with baseline brain mets still have worse OS, underlining need for early detection and integrated CNS monitoring (1996P,1998P).\n\nPriority engagements this quarter (specific KOLs and ask)\n- Dr. Frank Griesinger, University of Oldenburg — discuss VISION intracranial subgroup, ask to co‑design the TEP‑CNS feasibility protocol (1996P/1995P).  \n- Prof. John Heymach, MD Anderson — discuss ctDNA substudy design and advisory board on MET testing algorithms.  \n- Dr. Julia Rotow, Dana‑Farber — partner on global MET testing education and RWE registry design (real‑world sequencing after 1L osimertinib).  \n- Dr. Antonio Passaro, IEO Milan & Dr. Aaron Mansfield, Mayo Clinic — engage on ADC sequencing and toxicity‑management guidance (teliso‑V).  \n- Dr. Enriqueta Felip, Vall d'Hebron — discuss bispecific (amivantamab) sequencing and SC administration implications.\n\n(Contact lists and local MSL territories: field ops to create outreach schedule and booking in next 2 weeks.)\n\n---\n\n### Medical Affairs Leadership — this month\nEvidence gaps / IST & RWE priorities (specific)\n1. TEP‑REAL registry (RWE) — prospective, multicenter registry for METex14 pts treated with tepotinib: required data elements = tissue/plasma testing method, baseline CNS status, central review of intracranial responses, serial ctDNA sampling (baseline, C2/C3, q8–12w, progression), subsequent therapies and outcomes. Target N=300 over 24 months. Owner: Head RWE/HEOR. Rationale: capture real‑world sequencing and post‑progression efficacy (addresses sequencing gap after ADCs/bispecifics).\n2. TEP‑CNS feasibility (prospective cohort) — single‑arm, METex14 mNSCLC with baseline brain mets; N≈40; primary endpoint intracranial ORR (IRC); secondary intracranial DOR, systemic PFS/OS, safety. Owner: Clinical Ops + Translational. Rationale: convert VISION intracranial signals into prospectively collected CNS label‑supportive data.\n3. ctDNA correlative substudy — partner with a commercial lab (e.g., Burning Rock or local validated vendor) to measure ctDNA clearance at C2/C3 and correlate with PFS and DOR (modeled on SACHI 1954P). Integrate into both RWE and TEP‑CNS programs.\n\nPublication & communication priorities (fast‑track)\n- Fast‑track 1: Manuscript /peer‑review submission of VISION 3‑year intracranial analysis (if not yet published) — controlled by Global Medical.  \n- Fast‑track 2: REAL‑MET retrospective intracranial outcomes manuscript with Japanese investigators (1998P).  \n- Rapid review article: “How to test for MET in 2026” — position paper co‑authored with pathology KOLs (Rotow, Griesinger, others) to clarify NGS/RNA/plasma vs IHC pathways.\n\nKOL partnerships (advisory board / IST leadership)\n- Convene a MET Sequencing Advisory Board within 8 weeks: invite Griesinger, Heymach, Rotow, Passaro, Mansfield, Felip. Output: diagnostic algorithm, RWE protocol, CNS trial design. Budget: allocate advisory honoraria and meeting logistics.\n\n---\n\n### Clinical Development / Medical Directors — evaluate this quarter\nLabel and development opportunities (specific proposals)\n- CNS claim pathway: sponsor‑investigated single‑arm intracranial trial (TEP‑CNS) as above — aim to generate prospective intracranial ORR/DOR data for label language/supporting label maintenance in regions with CNS claim requirements.\n- Combination feasibility: assess tepotinib + osimertinib in METamp EGFRm after osimertinib progression — immediate step: preclinical PK/PD and safety assessment plus small (N=20–30) open‑label safety lead‑in with ctDNA clearance endpoints before expanding (compare SAVANNAH benchmarks). Rationale: SACHI 1954P and SAVANNAH 1958P demonstrate clinical proof of principle but safety signals require careful assessment.\n- Post‑ADC sequencing study: small prospective cohort to evaluate efficacy of tepotinib after progression on telisotuzumab vedotin or amivantamab — collect response rates and resistance mechanisms via tissue/ctDNA.\n\nBiomarker strategy (actionable)\n- Promote NGS (DNA+RNA splice‑aware) and validated plasma CDx adoption for METex14 detection. Provide pathology slide‑by‑slide workflows and reimbursement messaging. Implement a pathologist education kit (IHC vs NGS decision tree) and a lab partner list (approved plasma CDx vendors).\n\nSafety and label monitoring\n- Update Investigator Brochure and safety SOPs to reflect class overlaps (edema, ILD risk) for combinations; establish standard AE management protocols to share with sites (edema prophylaxis, LFT monitoring, VTE prophylaxis considerations for bispecific combos).\n\n---\n\n### HQ Leadership (strategic decisions this quarter)\nFunding & resource asks (clear, immediate)\n- Approve €X million (budget to be detailed) to: (a) launch TEP‑REAL registry (vendor selection & data capture); (b) fund 1‑day global MET Sequencing advisory board (Q1 calendar); (c) pre‑clinical/PK combo evaluation for tepotinib + osimertinib.\n- Diagnostic partnerships: fast‑track negotiations with 1–2 plasma CDx vendors (co‑marketing, lab access) and with pathology societies to support VENTANA SP44 dialogue (avoid confusion with ADC selection).\n- BD scouting: evaluate acquiring/partnering for ADC‑sequencing insights or an early bispecific asset (if strategic to secure downstream positioning). Put a small BD scouting team on this for 6 weeks.\n\nImmediate competitive response (operational)\n- Update global MSL slide deck in 10 business days to include:\n  - crisp VISION 3‑year bullets, CNS data, practical MET testing algorithm, sequencing flowchart vs ADC/combination options.\n- Initiate payer HEOR briefings in top 6 markets to highlight durability and potential cost‑offsets versus ADCs (e.g., longer DOR, outpatient oral administration).\n\n---\n\n## Where we stand — Page 3\nBefore ESMO\n- Tepotinib (Tepmetko) = approved option for metastatic NSCLC with METex14 (established guideline preference). Core value proposition: oral selective MET TKI for a genomic driver; plasma CDx exists to capture patients.\n\nWhat ESMO changed\n- VISION 3‑year follow‑up (1996P/1995P) solidified long‑term systemic and intracranial durability. REAL‑MET (1998P) validated intracranial responses in real practice but showed worse OS in baseline brain mets. ctDNA (SACHI 1954P) and combination strategies (SAVANNAH 1958P) showed how METamp is being treated in EGFRm resistance. Telisotuzumab vedotin (LUMINOSITY 1948P/1951P) delivered CDx validation and toxicity‑management data that lower adoption barriers for ADCs.\n\nOur position now — defend and selectively extend\n- Defend: METex14 genomic niche — emphasize durability, CNS activity, oral convenience and clarity of biomarker pathway (NGS/plasma).  \n- Vulnerabilities: biomarker fragmentation (IHC vs NGS/plasma), ADCs capturing MET‑OE patients with a validated CDx, and EGFR+MET combos dominating METamp.  \n- Opportunity: claim/label maintenance via prospective CNS data, own ctDNA evidence for tepotinib as early PD marker, and lead the diagnostic harmonization conversation.\n\n---\n\n## Key evidence & strategic context — (Practice‑changing studies)\n| Study (ID) | Short summary (key numbers) | Why it matters | Timing/Impact |\n|---|---:|---|---|\n| VISION 3‑yr (1996P) | Tissue+ ORR 54.8% (n=208), mDOR 17.4 mo, mPFS 13.7 mo, mOS 22.3 mo; 1L T+ ORR 59.5% mDOR 31.7 mo | Confirms durable systemic activity and intracranial signals for tepotinib; cornerstone for METex14 positioning | Immediate – use in HCP/payer messaging |\n| VISION sequencing (1995P) | Tepotinib earlier yields longer DOR (1L mDOR 31.7 mo vs 2L+ 12.6 mo); dose modifications frequent but feasible | Supports prioritizing tepotinib earlier in METex14 patients | Immediate clinical messaging |\n| REAL‑MET (1998P) | Real‑world intracranial ORR ~67% (11 evaluable pts) but brain‑mets pts had worse OS (16.6 vs 31.3 mo) | Confirms intracranial activity in practice; highlights unmet need for CNS‑specific strategy | Immediate RWE messaging; drives CNS study need |\n| SAVANNAH safety (1958P) | Osi + savo AESIs: hepatotoxicity 35% (any), edema 58% (11% ≥G3), VTE 24% (7% G3) | Combo effective in METamp but safety requires mitigation; predictable AEs (LFT monitoring, edema/VTE surveillance) | Immediate for combination safety guidance |\n| SACHI ctDNA (1954P) | ctDNA EGFRm clearance C2/C3: 74% (savo+osi) vs 46% (chemo); ctDNA clearance associated with longer PFS | ctDNA is actionable early PD biomarker for MET combos — adopt similar correlative work for tepotinib | Near term — adopt in RWE/substudies |\n| Telisotuzumab vedotin LUMINOSITY (1948P/1951P/1950P) | ORR ~29% (c‑Met OE) / ~34.5% (c‑Met high); VENTANA MET SP44 CDx concordant; ocular AEs ~25% (mostly ≤G2); dose modifications preserve efficacy | ADC option for MET IHC‑selected patients; validated CDx lowers adoption friction; ADC toxicities manageable with protocols | Immediate threat in MET‑OE patients; implement sequencing guidance |\n| Amivantamab (1960P,2082eTiP) | SC formulation + chemo ORR ~47%, mPFS ~7.9 mo; SC reduces infusion reactions; mechanistic data support EGFR/MET dual binding | Bispecifics actively operationalized (SC, prophylaxis) — threat in EGFR+MET contexts | Near term — monitor SC adoption/prophylaxis outcomes |\n| DO‑2 (928P) | First‑in‑human deuterated MET‑TKI: early confirmed PR in METex14, 100% DCR in 6 treatment‑naïve METex14 pts; tolerable safety (minimal edema reported) | Novel MET TKIs may differentiate on tolerability/PK; potential future competitor | Monitor expansion cohorts |\n\n---\n\n## Competitive threats — and how we counter\n- Telisotuzumab vedotin (AbbVie) — threat: validated IHC CDx (VENTANA SP44) + ADC adoption. Counter: rapid pathology education, co‑develop NGS/plasma + IHC decision tree, highlight tepotinib durability and CNS data in METex14 (1996P vs 1948P).\n- EGFR+MET combinations (savolitinib+osimertinib) — threat: effective in METamp post‑osimertinib with ctDNA clearance (1954P). Counter: evaluate tepotinib combination feasibility with careful safety lead‑in; emphasize difference between METex14 driver vs METamp acquired resistance.\n- Amivantamab bispecific (SC) — threat: operational ease with SC and prophylaxis reduces ARR/VTE barriers. Counter: track COPERNICUS/SC uptake, prepare sequencing guidance and VTE prophylaxis advisory jointly with KOLs.\n- Novel MET TKIs/ADC innovation (DO‑2, MYTX‑011) — threat: may change tolerability or expand ADC‑eligible populations. Counter: monitor expansion cohort data and prepare rapid RWE/PK crosswalks.\n\n---\n\n## Evidence gaps & what we should own (specific programs)\n1.

Simultaneously monitor ADC and bispecific adoption and prepare payer/HEOR countermeasures. These actions preserve first‑mover advantage in METex14 and close the most immediate commercial and clinical vulnerabilities identified at ESMO 2025.\n\n--- \n\nIf you want, I will:\n- Draft the MSL slide additions + 1‑page objection FAQ (48‑hour turnaround).  \n- Circulate a proposed TEP‑REAL protocol synopsis and budget estimate for HQ sign‑off.  \n- Produce the MET Testing Toolkit (pathologist one‑pager + lab vendor shortlist)."
