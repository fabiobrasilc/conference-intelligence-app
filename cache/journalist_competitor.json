    "analysis": "# Competitive Intelligence Report: Bladder Cancer at ESMO 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\nESMO 2025 Bladder Cancer competitor activity centers on consolidation of the enfortumab vedotin (EV) backbone, with EV+pembrolizumab (EV+P) driving the largest share of presentations, and a steady build of EV monotherapy real‑world/biomarker evidence across challenging subgroups. ADC expansion beyond EV is visible via HER2-targeted disitamab vedotin (DV) combinations, while perioperative/adjuvant immunotherapy (durvalumab platforms; ctDNA-guided atezolizumab) continues to migrate upstream. For Avelumab (Bavencio) 1L maintenance, the chemo-first patient pool is under pressure as EV+P dominates 1L and perioperative strategies advance; post-EV sequencing and biomarker‑defined niches (FGFR, HER2) are strategic. Priority actions: 1) Intensify education on optimal sequencing post-EV and positioning when chemo-first remains preferred, 2) Engage KOLs on HER2/Nectin‑4 testing and post-EV pathways, 3) Generate/curate comparative RWE to defend chemo→avelumab maintenance in appropriate centers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview\nContext current as of January 2025. Verify critical details with latest NCCN/ESMO guidelines.\n\n### 1.1 Current Treatment Paradigm in Bladder Cancer\n- NCCN 2025 and ESMO 2024 eUpdate\n  - Metastatic/locally advanced UC (la/mUC):\n    - 1L across cisplatin eligibility: EV+pembrolizumab is preferred based on superior OS/PFS vs gemcitabine/platinum.\n    - 1L cisplatin-eligible option: Nivolumab+gemcitabine/cisplatin (CheckMate‑901) is approved and guideline-endorsed.\n    - 1L chemo-first path: For centers/patients remaining on platinum (gem/cis or gem/carbo), avelumab (Bavencio) 1L maintenance is standard-of-care for non-progressors.\n  - Post‑EV progression: Unmet need; options include switch chemotherapy and erdafitinib for susceptible FGFR2/3 alterations.\n  - Perioperative/MIBC: Rapidly evolving. EV+pembrolizumab (EV-303/KEYNOTE‑B15) met dual primaries at interim (Aug 2025) and may re-shape curative‑intent care; multiple perioperative IO/ADC strategies are maturing.\n\n- Treatment sequence (typical, recognizing center variability)\n  - 1L: EV+pembro (dominant) or nivolumab+GC (cis‑eligible) or platinum chemo alone (declining share).\n  - 1L maintenance: Avelumab for non‑progressors after platinum chemo.\n  - 2L/3L+: If EV used 1L, options include chemotherapy; if chemo used 1L (without EV), EV monotherapy is active; biomarker‑driven options include erdafitinib (FGFR2/3+); clinical trials increasingly split by HER2/Nectin‑4/FGFR status.\n\n- Where Bavencio fits\n  - Avelumab remains the only PD‑(L)1 therapy with proven OS benefit as switch‑maintenance after 1L platinum in la/mUC; it is embedded in NCCN/ESMO for patients managed with chemotherapy first.\n  - Strategic dependence on the size of the chemo-first pool; requires clear guidance on patient selection, safety, and sequencing in the EV+P era.\n\n### 1.2 Approved Competitive Drugs\n- EV (enfortumab vedotin) + pembrolizumab\n  - 1L la/mUC: Full (traditional) approval in Dec 2023; entrenched in 2024–2025 practice across cis‑eligibility.\n- Nivolumab\n  - 1L cisplatin-eligible: With GC (CM‑901) approved Mar 6, 2024.\n  - Adjuvant high‑risk MIUC: Approved based on CheckMate‑274.\n- Pembrolizumab\n  - Combined with EV as 1L standard; monotherapy utility is reduced in mUC by EV+P dominance, but persists in select contexts per guidelines/labels.\n- Atezolizumab\n  - No current broad US/EU mUC approval in the metastatic setting; major ongoing perioperative/adjuvant programs (e.g., ctDNA‑guided strategies).\n- Durvalumab\n  - No mUC label; multiple phase 2/3 perioperative/NMIBC programs.\n- Sacituzumab govitecan\n  - mUC indication voluntarily withdrawn in 2024, consolidating EV’s role post‑platinum.\n- Erdafitinib\n  - FGFR2/3‑altered la/mUC: Approved in post‑platinum settings.\n- Disitamab vedotin (RC48)\n  - HER2‑targeted ADC with approvals in China; global phase 3 programs (including PD‑1 combinations) progressing.\n\n### 1.3 EMD Serono’s Competitive Position\n- Avelumab (Bavencio) 1L maintenance remains the standard for patients receiving platinum chemotherapy first, with mature OS data and broad guideline endorsement.\n- Differentiators\n  - Proven OS benefit as maintenance after chemo; defined, protocolized timing for switch‑maintenance; tolerability suitable for continuation after cytotoxic therapy.\n- Competitive threats\n  - Upfront EV+P reduces the chemo-first pool; perioperative EV+P and IO strategies may reduce future metastatic presentations.\n  - Biomarker‑segmented entrants (HER2 ADCs like disitamab vedotin ± PD‑1; niche FGFR inhibitors) could redirect segments away from chemotherapy-first pathways.\n  - Post‑EV sequencing data gaps create vulnerability unless Medical Affairs leads on evidence synthesis for post‑EV pathways and identifies patient subsets best served by chemo→maintenance.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

    "analysis": "# Competitive Intelligence Report: Lung Cancer at ESMO 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\nESMO 2025 Lung Cancer competitor activity centers on amivantamab as the sole MET-relevant presentation identified in the curated dataset, highlighting a cross-tumor strategy targeting EGFR/MET aberrations rather than METex14-specific TKI competition. Notably absent are capmatinib, telisotuzumab vedotin, or savolitinib data, suggesting limited direct head-to-head positioning versus tepotinib at this meeting’s lung cancer track. For EMD Serono, this places emphasis on defending the METex14 TKI space through diagnostic leadership (plasma CDx), durability/CNS outcomes, and RWE, while monitoring bispecific encroachment via basket strategies. Priority actions: (1) engage European KOLs around amivantamab’s basket program and its implications for MET-driven resistance segments; (2) intensify education on plasma CDx and tepotinib’s real-world outcomes/CNS profile; (3) prepare contrast narratives versus MET-directed ADCs and bispecifics for c-MET overexpression and EGFR-resistance niches ahead of broader ESMO guideline shifts.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview\n*Context current as of January 2025. Verify critical details with latest NCCN/ESMO guidelines.*\n\n### 1.1 Current Treatment Paradigm in Lung Cancer\n- Guidelines (NCCN v7.2024+; ESMO anticipated 2025 updates):\n  - Comprehensive upfront molecular profiling is standard for metastatic NSCLC, including METex14, MET amplification, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS G12C, BRAF, RET, NTRK, HER2, and PD-L1.\n  - MET-altered NSCLC subsegments:\n    - MET exon 14 skipping (METex14, ~2–3% NSCLC): selective MET TKIs are preferred (tepotinib, capmatinib) in 1L and subsequent lines.\n    - High-level MET amplification (METamp, ~1–2% in treatment-naive; higher post-TKI): managed with MET TKIs and, increasingly, MET-targeted ADCs in later lines; clinical trial participation encouraged.\n    - MET-driven acquired resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC post-osimertinib: addressed with amivantamab-based strategies ± chemotherapy, or investigational dual EGFR+MET TKI combinations (e.g., osimertinib+savolitinib).\n  - Outside MET: 1L paradigms are driver-dependent (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS G12C, RET, BRAF, NTRK, HER2) or IO-based for non-oncogene-driven disease.\n\n- Standard treatment sequence:\n  - 1L METex14: tepotinib or capmatinib; IO monotherapy is generally deprioritized due to modest benefit in METex14 despite variable PD-L1.\n  - 2L+ METex14: alternate MET TKI if not used 1L, chemo ± IO as appropriate, clinical trials, and selective use of MET-directed ADCs in MET-high settings where applicable.\n  - METamp: MET TKI or trial; consider ADCs (e.g., telisotuzumab vedotin) for c-MET IHC 3+ after prior therapy.\n  - EGFR-mutant with MET-driven resistance post-osimertinib: amivantamab-based regimens; investigational osimertinib+savolitinib.\n\n- Tepotinib (Tepmetko) positioning:\n  - NCCN-preferred for metastatic NSCLC with METex14; now supported by a plasma-based CDx enabling liquid-biopsy detection.\n  - Key differentiators to emphasize: broad CDx accessibility (plasma), durability of response, CNS activity, and real-world data supporting use in elderly/comorbid populations.\n\n### 1.2 Approved Competitive Drugs\n- Selective MET TKIs (METex14):\n  - Tepotinib (EMD Serono/Merck KGaA): FDA traditional approval (Feb 15, 2024) for metastatic NSCLC with METex14; NCCN-preferred; liquid-biopsy CDx approved (Nov 2024). EMA-approved.\n  - Capmatinib (Novartis): FDA/EMA approved for METex14 metastatic NSCLC in 1L+; class-overlapping efficacy/toxicity (notably edema, ILD risk); guideline-preferred alongside tepotinib.\n  - Savolitinib (AstraZeneca/Hutchmed): Approved in China for METex14 NSCLC; key role in combinations for EGFR-mutant MET-driven resistance (investigational outside China).\n\n- MET-directed ADCs:\n  - Telisotuzumab vedotin (AbbVie): FDA approval (Nov 27, 2024) for previously treated c-MET overexpressing (IHC 3+) NSCLC; offers a biomarker-defined ADC pathway for MET-high disease irrespective of METex14. Safety profile notable for ILD, stomatitis, cytopenias.\n\n- EGFR/MET bispecific:\n  - Amivantamab (Janssen): Approved in EGFR exon20ins and in 1L EGFR-mutant in combination with lazertinib (US, 2024); clinically addresses MET-mediated resistance via its MET-binding domain. Not labeled for METex14, but is strategically relevant for MET-driven resistance segments.\n\n- Other relevant agents/strategies:\n  - Dual EGFR+MET TKI combinations (e.g., osimertinib+savolitinib) in trials for METamp and MET-driven resistance after osimertinib; potential to erode segments where MET TKIs or ADCs could position.\n  - Crizotinib: Multi-target TKI with MET activity; not approved for METex14 and largely supplanted by selective MET TKIs.\n\n### 1.3 EMD Serono's Competitive Position\n- Comparative profile:\n  - Tepotinib vs capmatinib: Similar class efficacy in METex14 with meaningful ORR and DOR; edema is a class AE. Differentiators for tepotinib include a validated plasma CDx pathway and emerging CNS/RWE support.\n  - Versus telisotuzumab vedotin: Different biomarker segment (IHC 3+ overexpression). ADCs may siphon later-line patients with MET-high disease regardless of genotype; toxicity profile differs (ILD/stomatitis), creating trade-offs.\n  - Versus amivantamab strategies: Primarily targets EGFR-driven populations; however, it competes for EGFR-mutant patients with MET-driven resistance and could encroach on METamp niches via chemo/bispecific regimens.\n\n- Key clinical differentiators to reinforce:\n  - Liquid-biopsy CDx enabling rapid identification and treatment initiation in frail/elderly patients.\n  - Durability of response and potential CNS activity data points (where available) vs class peers.\n  - Real-world effectiveness and tolerability profile, including edema management best practices and dose optimization.\n\n- Main competitive threats:\n  - Fragmentation of MET-altered NSCLC into micro-niches (METex14 vs METamp vs MET IHC 3+) enabling non-TKI competitors (ADCs, bispecifics).\n  - Growing amivantamab-based strategies for MET-driven resistance in EGFR-mutant disease that could decrease second-line TKI utilization.\n  - Payer and diagnostic gatekeeping: uptake of plasma NGS and IHC testing patterns will shape funnel sizes for TKIs vs ADCs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. ESMO 2025 Competitor Activity Analysis\n\n### 2.1 Competitor Presentation Volume and Focus\nAt ESMO 2025, the most prominent competitor regimens by presentation volume were:\n1.

Schlenk — NCT Heidelberg (Germany)\n   - Session: 10/19/2025 — Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: This basket, focused on MET and/or EGFR aberrations, underscores Janssen’s strategy to extend amivantamab across biomarker-defined niches, including MET-driven resistance contexts. For EMD, this highlights a need to defend METex14 as a distinct genotype-driven space requiring selective MET TKIs, while monitoring amivantamab’s data trajectory in METamp and post-osimertinib resistance cohorts where bispecifics may compete with MET TKIs or MET-ADC approaches.\n\n### 2.3 Emerging Threats and Novel Approaches\n[Not included due to limited MET-competitive activity (1 study).]\n\n### 2.4 Geographic and Institutional Patterns\n- Geographic Distribution:\n  - United States:\n    - Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston): Targeted therapy expertise; potential cross-talk on resistance biology.\n  - Europe:\n    - NCT Heidelberg (Germany): Amivantamab basket poster; key hub for EGFR/MET bispecific development.\n    - Barcelona (Spain) institutions (VHIR, IMIM/Hospital del Mar, Hospital Clínic): Strong translational/biomarker presence; potential partners for diagnostics/RWE.\n    - UK (Aberystwyth University): Real-world data infrastructure—useful for RWE collaborations.\n  - Asia/China:\n    - Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (Tongji Univ.): Early-phase targeted programs; potential rapid adoption of novel targeted/bispecific regimens.\n    - JFCR (Tokyo): First-in-human targeted studies; experienced in precision oncology trial operations.\n    - Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Hangzhou (China): Active in early-phase IO/targeted modalities; potential sites for MET combo exploration.\n\n- Top KOLs (≥2 high-impact abstracts):\n  - None identified in this dataset (no investigator appears on ≥2 high-impact MET-relevant abstracts).\n\n- Regional Patterns and Insights:\n  - Europe shows visible leadership in amivantamab’s cross-tumor exploration (NCT Heidelberg), reinforcing a need for proactive engagement in EU centers with EGFR/MET bispecific expertise.\n  - Spain’s translational groups are highly active in biomarker science—opportunity to expand plasma CDx utilization studies for METex14.\n  - China and Japan continue to drive early-phase targeted innovation; watch for rapid pivot into MET combinations or basket expansions that could enter global development.\n  - Strategic implications: Prioritize EU engagement around bispecific narratives; expand diagnostic partnerships in Spain to accelerate METex14 identification; maintain Asia-Pacific intelligence coverage for early MET combination signals that could prefigure global trials."

    "analysis": "# Competitive Intelligence Report: Colorectal Cancer at ESMO 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\nESMO 2025 Colorectal Cancer competitor activity centers on ctDNA-guided anti-EGFR rechallenge and sequencing strategies in metastatic disease, alongside liquid biopsy–driven perioperative decision-making and an early first-in-class MYB inhibitor signal. Two late-breaking randomized trials (CITRIC, PARERE) directly shape late-line sequencing for RAS/RAF WT disease and may expand/normalize anti-EGFR rechallenge guided by ctDNA, while PEGASUS reinforces MRD-driven management with potential downstream effects on metastatic monitoring and rechallenge eligibility. For EMD Serono, these trends are a double-edged sword: they validate sustained anti-EGFR utility for cetuximab in late lines but could crowd the 3L+ space that precemtabart tocentecan (M9140) targets, necessitating clear CEACAM5 selection and outcomes differentiation versus small-molecule standards and EGFR retreatment. Priority actions: (1) equip MSLs with ctDNA-rechallenge evidence and pragmatic selection/monitoring guidance for cetuximab; (2) ensure M9140 registrational design incorporates ctDNA/MRD and definitive head-to-heads versus fruquintinib/TAS-102±bev with strong ORR/PFS endpoints; (3) engage European ctDNA KOL networks (Spain/Italy) for evidence generation and diagnostic pathway alignment, including CEACAM5 Dx integration.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview\n*Context current as of January 2025. Verify critical details with latest NCCN/ESMO guidelines.*\n\n### 1.1 Current Treatment Paradigm in Colorectal Cancer\n- 1L metastatic (MSS/pMMR):\n  - Backbone chemotherapy: FOLFOX or FOLFIRI ± biologics; FOLFOXIRI ± bevacizumab for high-risk/fit patients.\n  - Left-sided, RAS/RAF WT: add an anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab) to maximize ORR/CR and conversion.\n  - Right-sided or RAS/RAF mutant: bevacizumab-based doublets preferred.\n- 1L metastatic (MSI-H/dMMR):\n  - PD-(L)1 therapy dominates (e.g., pembrolizumab monotherapy); dual I/O may be used per guideline discretion and regional approvals.\n- Biomarker-directed therapy in 2L+:\n  - KRAS G12C: adagrasib + cetuximab (accelerated approval, 2024) and sotorasib + panitumumab (full approval, Jan 2025) post FOLFOX/FOLFIRI establish EGFR+G12C doublets as standard in this niche.\n  - BRAF V600E: encorafenib + anti-EGFR after prior therapy.\n  - HER2+ (RAS WT): tucatinib + trastuzumab after standard chemotherapy.\n  - NTRK/RET/ALK rare fusions: tumor-agnostic TKIs.\n- 3L+ MSS/pMMR refractory:\n  - Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) ± bevacizumab, regorafenib, fruquintinib are standards; ORR modest (≈1–5%), highlighting unmet need for response-driving agents.\n- Where EMD assets fit:\n  - Cetuximab (Erbitux) anchors 1L in RAS/RAF WT left-sided mCRC with chemotherapy; also a core partner in KRAS G12C doublets (adagrasib) and rechallenge strategies in later lines.\n  - Precemtabart tocentecan (M9140), a CEACAM5-directed Topo-I ADC, is positioned for 3L+ MSS/pMMR CEACAM5-selected mCRC; emerging data support a registrational path versus small-molecule standards, with ORR/PFS differentiation as key.\n\n### 1.2 Approved Competitive Drugs\n- Anti-EGFR:\n  - Cetuximab; panitumumab — 1L for RAS/RAF WT left-sided mCRC with chemo; retreatment/rechallenge supported by growing ctDNA evidence.\n  - KRAS G12C doublets: adagrasib + cetuximab (AA 2024); sotorasib + panitumumab (full approval 2025) after FOLFOX/FOLFIRI.\n- Anti-VEGF/angiogenesis:\n  - Bevacizumab (± maintenance); aflibercept, ramucirumab with FOLFIRI in later lines.\n  - Fruquintinib (2023) expands VEGFR TKI options for refractory mCRC.\n- Cytotoxics (late-line):\n  - Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102), regorafenib — cornerstone small-molecule standards in 3L+ MSS/pMMR.\n- MSI-H/dMMR I/O:\n  - Pembrolizumab 1L; other PD-(L)1-based approaches as per guideline/regional variation after prior therapy.\n- Other biomarker-directed:\n  - Encorafenib + anti-EGFR (BRAF V600E); tucatinib + trastuzumab (HER2+ RAS WT mCRC, refractory).\n- Regulatory dynamics (2024–2025):\n  - KRAS G12C doublets established in guidelines; HER2+ regimen listed for refractory disease; late-line small-molecule standards remain entrenched pending ADC head-to-heads.\n\n### 1.3 EMD Serono's Competitive Position\n- Cetuximab (Erbitux) strengths:\n  - Foundational in 1L left-sided RAS/RAF WT mCRC with superior response metrics vs bevacizumab strategies; critical partner for KRAS G12C (adagrasib) and rechallenge paradigms.\n  - Differentiation levers: depth of response and conversion potential in 1L; established global familiarity; potential ADCC contribution (IgG1) vs panitumumab (IgG2).\n- Cetuximab competitive threats:\n  - Panitumumab competition in 1L and as mandated partner in sotorasib combinations; ctDNA-guided rechallenge may be executed with either EGFR mAb.\n  - Evolving liquid biopsy standards may favor centers with set panitumumab pathways; need to embed cetuximab across rechallenge algorithms.\n- Precemtabart tocentecan (M9140) opportunities:\n  - Targets 3L+ MSS/pMMR where ORR is limited with small molecules; CEACAM5 prevalence offers sizable addressable subset; Topo-I ADCs can deliver bystander effect and deeper responses.\n- M9140 risks:\n  - Fragmentation of 3L+ into micro-niches (KRAS G12C, HER2, ctDNA-EGFR rechallenge) may shrink the immediately eligible pool and complicate sequencing.\n  - Safety class considerations (ILD/pneumonitis, stomatitis) require proactive risk management; definitive comparative efficacy vs fruquintinib/TAS-102±bev is essential.\n- Strategic imperatives:\n  - Own ctDNA-guided EGFR rechallenge with cetuximab education and evidence partnerships.\n  - Advance a registrational M9140 study with strong PFS primary and ORR/OS key secondaries, head-to-head vs small-molecule standards; integrate CEACAM5 companion Dx and ctDNA endpoints to future-proof positioning.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Oral MYB transcription factor inhibitor (Count: 1 study)\n   - MOA Class: Transcription factor inhibitor (MYB)\n   - Development Phase: Phase I\n   - Key Abstracts: 1018eTiP\n   - Brief note: First-in-class early signal; potential niche biology in CRC explored.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Dominant MOA classes: Liquid biopsy/ctDNA–guided therapeutic strategies (3/4) shaping both metastatic rechallenge/sequencing and perioperative pathways.\n- Surprising entrants: A first-in-class MYB inhibitor in CRC suggests ongoing target diversification beyond kinase and ADC paradigms.\n- Strategic implications for EMD:\n  - Reinforces the need to integrate ctDNA into anti-EGFR lifecycle management (rechallenge criteria, monitoring) for cetuximab.\n  - Late-line space (target for M9140) may be increasingly occupied by ctDNA-enabled EGFR retreatment and optimized sequencing vs regorafenib; M9140 must demonstrate superior response depth/duration and manageable safety in CEACAM5-selected patients to displace these strategies.\n  - Early engagement with MRD leaders is important to harmonize CEACAM5 testing with emerging ctDNA workflows.\n\n### 2.2 High-Priority Competitor Studies\n1. LBA33 — ctDNA-guided anti-EGFR rechallenge: CITRIC (final results)\n   - Investigators: Clara Montagut — Hospital del Mar Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona\n   - Session: 10/18/2025 — Proffered Paper\n   - Strategic Relevance: A positive ctDNA-guided rechallenge paradigm would embed anti-EGFR reintroduction into routine late-line care for RAS/RAF WT patients, expanding demand for anti-EGFR agents. For cetuximab, this is an opportunity to lead rechallenge protocols; for M9140, it defines a higher bar in 3L+ where CEACAM5 selection must demonstrate superior ORR/PFS versus rechallenge and small-molecule standards.\n\n2. LBA32 — Panitumumab retreatment followed by regorafenib vs reverse: PARERE (final results)\n   - Investigators: Marco Maria M. Germani — University of Pisa, Pisa\n   - Session: 10/18/2025 — Proffered Paper\n   - Strategic Relevance: Clarifies sequencing between EGFR retreatment and regorafenib in chemorefractory, ctDNA RAS/BRAF WT mCRC. If EGFR-first sequencing is favored, cetuximab can be positioned as the rechallenge agent of choice; if regorafenib-first is favored, M9140’s differentiation must focus on response depth and symptom relief after TKI exposure.\n\n3. 723O — PEGASUS: Post-surgical liquid biopsy–guided treatment in stage II/III colon cancer (final results)\n   - Investigators: Silvia Marsoni — Niguarda Cancer Center, Milan\n   - Session: 10/18/2025 — Proffered Paper\n   - Strategic Relevance: MRD-driven adjuvant management may standardize ctDNA workflows across institutions, facilitating downstream metastatic monitoring and anti-EGFR rechallenge candidate identification. For EMD, alignment with MRD centers supports educational pathways for cetuximab rechallenge and informs M9140 trial designs incorporating ctDNA-defined residual disease dynamics.\n\n4. 1018eTiP — RGT-61159: Oral MYB transcription factor inhibitor (Phase I)\n   - Investigators: Alan L. Ho — Memorial Sloan Kettering; Weill Cornell; NewYork-Presbyterian\n   - Session: 10/19/2025 — ePoster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Although early, a novel transcription factor target underscores the trend toward niche biology in refractory CRC. For M9140, this signals intensifying competition for biomarker-defined late-line segments; maintaining CEACAM5 Dx rigor and demonstrating clinically meaningful responses will be critical.\n\n### 2.3 Emerging Threats and Novel Approaches\n1. LBA33 — ctDNA-guided anti-EGFR rechallenge — Biomarker-guided recycling\n   - Phase: Phase II randomized\n   - Why This Is a Threat: If widely adopted, rechallenge could occupy 3L slots in RAS/RAF WT patients, potentially delaying or reducing the addressable population for ADCs like M9140; it also raises expectations for biomarker-driven selection in late lines.\n\n2. LBA32 — EGFR vs regorafenib sequencing — Optimized salvage sequencing\n   - Phase: Randomized (phase NR)\n   - Why This Is a Threat: A definitive sequence standard may harden payer and practice pathways, requiring M9140 to surpass sequence-optimized outcomes rather than single-agent benchmarks.\n\n3. 723O — MRD-guided adjuvant therapy — Perioperative ctDNA normalization\n   - Phase: Prospective trial (phase NR)\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Institutionalization of ctDNA testing in early disease accelerates ecosystem readiness for liquid biopsy in metastatic settings, raising the bar for any late-line therapy to integrate ctDNA endpoints and dynamic monitoring.\n\n4. 1018eTiP — MYB inhibitor — First-in-class target exploration\n   - Phase: Phase I\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Expands the array of non-ADC, biomarker-driven approaches that could claim micro-niches within refractory CRC, increasing competition for trial-eligible patients and attention from KOLs.\n\n### 2.4 Geographic and Institutional Patterns\n- Geographic Distribution:\n  - United States:\n    - Memorial Sloan Kettering / Weill Cornell / NewYork-Presbyterian — Early-phase targeted therapy (MYB inhibitor; 1018eTiP)\n  - Europe:\n    - Spain: Hospital del Mar Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona — ctDNA-guided EGFR rechallenge (LBA33)\n    - Italy: University of Pisa, Pisa — EGFR vs regorafenib sequencing (LBA32)\n    - Italy: Niguarda Cancer Center, Milan — MRD-guided adjuvant management (723O)\n  - Asia/China:\n    - No studies identified in this dataset\n  - Other regions:\n    - Not represented in this dataset\n\n- Top KOLs (≥2 high-impact abstracts):\n  - None identified in this dataset\n\n- Regional Patterns and Insights:\n  - Europe (Spain/Italy) is leading ctDNA-enabled strategies across the continuum (rechallenge, sequence optimization, adjuvant MRD), representing critical networks for guideline-shaping evidence.\n  - United States centers emphasize first-in-class targets and early-phase drug development, aligning with future combination opportunities (e.g., ADC + novel targeted).\n  - Strategic implications:\n    - Prioritize engagement with Barcelona and Italian GONO/MRD networks to co-develop ctDNA-based rechallenge pathways featuring cetuximab and to embed CEACAM5 testing alongside ctDNA workflows.\n    - In the U.S., cultivate partnerships for M9140 combination strategies and translational biomarker work (CEACAM5 expression thresholds, bystander effect biomarkers), leveraging early-phase infrastructure."

Multiple HNSCC-focused abstracts evaluate PD-1 combinations (including with cetuximab) and neoadjuvant approaches, while biomarker efforts (PD-L1 assay concordance, immune profiling) press toward more refined patient selection. For Cetuximab (Erbitux), the signal is twofold: sustained relevance via EGFR–IO combinations and cisplatin-ineligible CRT, but rising pressure from TGFβ-modulating IO and next-gen EGFR-targeted ADCs in head and neck subsites (notably NPC). Priority actions: 1) amplify real-world and translational evidence for cetuximab in PD-L1–negative/IO-ineligible and rapid debulking scenarios, 2) actively shape and support EGFR–IO combination narratives (mechanistic rationale, safety, responders), and 3) engage Asian centers leading perioperative/organ-preservation trials to secure EGFR-including combinations and biomarker-enriched substudies.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview\n*Context current as of January 2025. Verify critical details with latest NCCN/ESMO guidelines.*\n\n### 1.1 Current Treatment Paradigm in Head and Neck Cancer\n- R/M 1L:\n  - For PD-L1 CPS ≥1: Pembrolizumab-based regimens per KEYNOTE-048 remain standard (pembrolizumab +/- platinum/5-FU; monotherapy often CPS ≥20).\n  - For PD-L1 <1 or IO-ineligible: Cetuximab + platinum/5-FU (EXTREME regimen) is guideline-endorsed and commonly used. Cetuximab is also a fallback when IO is contraindicated.\n- R/M 2L+:\n  - IO monotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) is preferred post-platinum; cetuximab monotherapy remains an option, particularly in IO-ineligible or previously IO-exposed patients.\n- Locally advanced (LA) curative:\n  - Concurrent cisplatin-based CRT is the standard. Cetuximab + RT is used for cisplatin-ineligible patients.\n  - Perioperative pembrolizumab (neoadjuvant + adjuvant) received US approval (June 2025; KEYNOTE-689) for resectable high-risk disease, inaugurating IO in surgical pathways and potentially impacting organ-preservation strategies.\n- Strategic reality for cetuximab:\n  - IO has reshaped 1L R/M PD-L1+ disease, but cetuximab retains critical niches: PD-L1–negative/low, IO-ineligible, IO-refractory settings, and cisplatin-ineligible LA CRT substitution. Differentiation hinges on rapid cytoreduction needs, HPV-negative subsets, and broad global access/familiarity.\n\n### 1.2 Approved Competitive Drugs\n- Immune checkpoint inhibitors:\n  - Pembrolizumab: 1L R/M HNSCC (CPS-based) and 2L; perioperative approval (June 2025) in resectable high-risk HNSCC.\n  - Nivolumab: 2L R/M post-platinum.\n  - Toripalimab: Approved in NPC (not pan-HNSCC), reinforcing IO momentum in head and neck subsites.\n- EGFR targeting:\n  - Cetuximab: 1L R/M (EXTREME for PD-L1 <1 or IO-ineligible), and LA cisplatin-ineligible with RT. No new anti-EGFR mAb approvals in HNSCC; cetuximab remains the only approved EGFR antibody in this disease.\n- Combination/adjacent agents:\n  - Negative phase 3 experiences (e.g., lenvatinib+pembrolizumab in HNSCC; xevinapant+CRT) have tempered some combination strategies.\n- Regulatory dynamics:\n  - Perioperative pembrolizumab entry into curative-intent treatment is the key 2025 update influencing surgical pathways and potentially organ preservation.\n  - No new EGFR-targeted approvals; attention shifts to investigational bispecifics and ADCs.\n\n### 1.3 EMD Serono's Competitive Position\n- Comparative positioning:\n  - In 1L R/M, cetuximab’s role is concentrated in PD-L1–negative/IO-ineligible populations and as an alternative when IO is contraindicated; it remains guideline-embedded for these niches.\n  - In LA cisplatin-ineligible patients, cetuximab + RT is established and clinically practical.\n- Clinical differentiators:\n  - Rapid cytoreduction potential in symptomatic bulky disease.\n  - Chemo-synergy and radiosensitization without immune-related toxicities—critical for IO-contraindicated patients.\n  - Deep real-world experience and implementation feasibility across diverse healthcare settings.\n- Main competitive threats:\n  - IO expansion into perioperative settings (KEYNOTE-689) could reduce opportunities for neoadjuvant EGFR-based strategies unless combined or biomarker-selected.\n  - Next-gen EGFR-targeted agents (e.g., EGFR/LGR5 or EGFR×HER3 bispecifics, ADCs) advancing in H&N subsites (notably NPC) may reposition EGFR targeting toward post-IO/chemo settings.\n  - IO+targeted combinations and TGFβ-modulating immunotherapies may improve outcomes in PD-L1–low or IO-refractory subsets, where cetuximab currently plays a critical role.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

LBA35 — EGFR×HER3 ADC (BL-B01D1) vs physician’s choice chemo in R/M NPC (pivotal)\n   - Investigators: Huaqiang Zhou — Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center\n   - Session: 10/19/2025, Proffered Paper\n   - Strategic Relevance: First randomized phase 3 readout for an EGFR×HER3 ADC in a head and neck subsite. If efficacy and tolerability are favorable, ADCs could encroach on post-IO lines and ultimately pressure EGFR mAbs in NPC, with potential platform spillover to broader HNSCC. EMD should monitor target selection (EGFR/HER3 expression), prior IO exposure strata, and safety trade-offs (e.g., dermatologic vs ADC-related toxicities).\n\n2. 1428P — Anti-PD-1 + cetuximab in R/M HNSCC: clinical biomarkers and outcomes\n   - Investigators: Michael Dennis — The Christie NHS Foundation Trust\n   - Session: 10/20/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Validates real-world/retrospective outcomes and biomarker associations for EGFR–IO combinations. This supports a clinically relevant positioning for cetuximab as a combination backbone in settings of high disease burden, PD-L1–low disease, or post-IO settings, where rapid debulking and immune priming may be synergistic.\n\n3. 1422P — Neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor or cetuximab + chemotherapy in recurrent, resectable HNSCC\n   - Investigators: Lei H. Tan — Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University\n   - Session: 10/20/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Directly juxtaposes perioperative PD-1–based vs EGFR-based neoadjuvant approaches in surgically salvageable recurrence. Findings (even from observational data) may influence MDT decisions at recurrence. EMD should prepare guidance for selecting cetuximab-based neoadjuvant therapy when IO is contraindicated or rapid cytoreduction is paramount.\n\n4. 1339P — Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + toripalimab for larynx organ preservation\n   - Investigators: YanFeng Chen — Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center\n   - Session: 10/20/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: IO-enabled organ preservation is a high-impact clinical goal in LA laryngeal/hypopharyngeal cancer. Success here could shift standard pathways away from immediate surgery. Cetuximab-based radiosensitization remains an alternative in cisplatin-ineligible patients—EMD should contrast benefit-risk and operational feasibility against IO-chemo protocols.\n\n5. 1347P — Post-treatment strategies after neoadjuvant PD-1 + chemotherapy in resectable OP/HP/LSCC\n   - Investigators: Xiaohong Chen — Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University\n   - Session: 10/20/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Addresses the “what next?” after perioperative IO-chemo—critical for real-world adoption. Sequencing insights (adjuvant therapy, RT integration) may influence where cetuximab + RT fits for patients unable to receive cisplatin or further IO.\n\n6. 1411P — Immune cell biomarker profile linked to longer PFS on PD-1 inhibitors in R/M HNSCC (DAHANCA cohort)\n   - Investigators: Sebastian Soby — (Denmark, national cohort)\n   - Session: 10/20/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Moves beyond PD-L1 CPS to immune cell phenotypes, which could stratify responders/non-responders. EMD should explore whether EGFR-expressing, immune-excluded phenotypes benefit from EGFR–IO combinations or cetuximab-alone strategies in IO-ineligible patients.\n\n7. 1415P — PD-L1 CPS assay concordance (SP263 vs 22C3) and correlation with TIGIT/CD155 in HNSCC\n   - Investigators: Myung-Ju Ahn — Samsung Medical Center\n   - Session: 10/20/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Assay harmonization impacts patient selection for IO and combination strategies. Discordance could misclassify patients who might otherwise receive cetuximab-based therapy per guidelines (e.g., PD-L1 <1). The TIGIT/CD155 correlation also informs future combination partners for EGFR or IO.\n\n8. 1522MO — INCA33890 (PD-1/TGFβR2 bispecific) first-in-human, advanced solid tumors\n   - Investigators: Elena Garralda — Vall d’Hebron, Barcelona\n   - Session: 10/17/2025, Mini Oral\n   - Strategic Relevance: Bispecific PD-1/TGFβ blockade targets immune exclusion and may elevate IO activity in PD-L1–low tumors—overlapping with cetuximab’s niche. If safety/early efficacy are acceptable, this approach could compete directly in settings where cetuximab is preferred today.\n\n9. 200eP — Dual PD-L1 + TGFβ inhibition: memory T-cell immunity in R/M NPC\n   - Investigators: Dora L. Kwong — University of Hong Kong/Queen Mary Hospital\n   - Session: 10/20/2025, ePoster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Reinforces the mechanistic rationale for TGFβ-modulated IO regimens. Should clinical efficacy translate, these combinations could erode EGFR-mAb utilization in subsets of NPC/HNSCC with TGFβ-driven exclusion.\n\n10. 1372P — Nab-paclitaxel + cisplatin + PD-1 inhibitor → concurrent chemoradiotherapy (LA NPC)\n   - Investigators: Bin Huang — The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University\n   - Session: 10/20/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Aggressive induction IO-chemo followed by cCRT may set a new intensification bar in NPC. Highlights the need for EMD to differentiate cetuximab + RT specifically in cisplatin-ineligible patients or explore EGFR-including induction strategies where IO is unsuitable.\n\n11. 1413P — DDAH1 drives cisplatin resistance via EGFR–JAK2–STAT3 in LA NPC\n   - Investigators: Jinhao Yang — Tianjin Medical University\n   - Session: 10/20/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Offers a biologic rationale for EGFR targeting in chemoresistant disease. Supports translational messaging that EGFR blockade can address resistance pathways in defined molecular contexts.\n\n### 2.3 Emerging Threats and Novel Approaches\n1. LBA35 — EGFR×HER3 ADC (BL-B01D1) in R/M NPC — Novel ADC threat\n   - Phase: Randomized phase 3\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Validates an EGFR/ErbB-targeted ADC in a head and neck subsite; could reshape post-IO treatment and challenge EGFR mAbs if efficacy/toxicity balance is favorable and expands beyond NPC.\n\n2. 1522MO / 200eP — TGFβ-modulating IO (PD-1/TGFβR2 bispecific; dual PD-L1+TGFβ) — IO resistance-overcoming strategies\n   - Phase: Phase 1 (bispecific) and translational (dual)\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Targets immune exclusion and fibrosis; may expand IO benefit into PD-L1–low tumors where cetuximab is standard today, potentially redefining 1L and perioperative strategies.\n\n3. 1428P — PD-1 + cetuximab in R/M HNSCC — EGFR–IO combination pivot\n   - Phase: Real-world biomarker/outcomes\n   - Why This Is a Threat: If consistent benefit emerges, guidelines could embrace combination approaches in earlier lines, forcing cetuximab monotherapy into narrower niches but also offering a platform opportunity.\n\n4. 1339P / 1347P / 1422P — Perioperative and organ-preservation IO — Pathway redesign\n   - Phase: Phase II/observational\n   - Why This Is a Threat: IO moving perioperatively and for organ preservation may compress the window for EGFR-based perioperative use unless combined, biomarker-selected, or reserved for IO-ineligible patients.\n\n5. 1411P / 1415P — Biomarker refinement (immune cell profiles, PD-L1 assay harmonization) — Selection precision\n   - Phase: Cohort/translational\n   - Why This Is a Threat: More precise IO selection may reduce the size of cetuximab-eligible populations unless EMD anchors EGFR use to distinct phenotypes (e.g., HPV-negative, PD-L1–negative, rapid debulking).\n\n### 2.4 Geographic and Institutional Patterns\n- Geographic Distribution:\n  - United States:\n    - MD Anderson Cancer Center (LBA70; NSCLC biomarker methods) — IO biomarker sophistication with cross-disease relevance.\n  - Europe:\n    - The Christie NHS Foundation Trust (1428P) — EGFR–IO combinations and biomarkers in R/M HNSCC.\n    - Vall d’Hebron, Barcelona (1522MO) — Early-phase bispecific IO with potential HNSCC applicability.\n    - Denmark (DAHANCA; 1411P) — National cohort immune biomarker profiling in HNSCC.\n  - Asia/China:\n    - Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou (LBA35, 1339P) — Phase 3 ADC in NPC; IO for organ preservation.\n    - The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (1372P) — IO-chemo induction → cCRT in NPC.\n    - Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University (1347P) — Post-neoadjuvant IO strategy optimization.\n    - Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University (1422P) — Perioperative PD-1 or cetuximab strategies in recurrent HNSCC.\n    - Samsung Medical Center, Seoul (1415P) — PD-L1 assay harmonization and co-inhibitory pathway correlations.\n    - Tianjin Medical University (1413P) — EGFR-mediated resistance biology.\n  - Other regions:\n    - Australia (Peter Mac; 916O) and Finland (Helsinki; 732MO) — Cross-tumor innovations with indirect relevance (KRAS inhibition, ctDNA methodologies).\n\n- Top KOLs (≥2 high-impact abstracts):\n  - None identified within this HNSCC-relevant subset; activity is distributed across multiple investigators, with notable institutional clustering at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center.\n\n- Regional Patterns and Insights:\n  - Asia/China: Driving head and neck innovation in NPC and laryngeal/hypopharyngeal cancers, particularly IO perioperative/organ-preservation strategies and ADC development. Strategic implication: prioritize engagement and potential collaborative substudies (EGFR–IO combinations, biomarker-enriched cohorts) with Sun Yat-sen and affiliated centers.\n  - Europe: Emphasis on EGFR–IO combinations in R/M HNSCC and biomarker harmonization (PD-L1 assays, immune profiles). Strategic implication: partner with UK/EU centers to co-lead real-world evidence and translational efforts that define cetuximab-responsive phenotypes.\n  - US: While HNSCC-specific volume is limited in this dataset, cross-disease IO biomarker leadership remains influential. Strategic implication: leverage US KOLs for methodological rigor (ctDNA, radiomics, immune phenotyping) in EMD-supported HNSCC studies.\n  - Overall: Institutional clusters (especially in China) are setting clinical direction in perioperative IO and ADCs; EMD should align early with these geographies to maintain EGFR’s role through combination, selection, and implementation science approaches."

    "analysis": "# Competitive Intelligence Report: Renal Cancer at ESMO 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\nESMO 2025 Renal Cancer COMPETITOR activity centers on intensification and optimization of immunotherapy backbones: first-line dual ICI exploration with adenosine-axis inhibition (ipi+nivo+ciforadenant), multiple translational biomarker readouts (LAG3, TREM2+ TAMs, cytokine correlates), real-world reinforcement of adjuvant pembrolizumab, and momentum for post-IO HIF-2α combinations (belzutifan+lenvatinib). The collective emphasis on PD-1/TKI biology, adjuvant utilization, and response-adapted tools (ctDNA-MRD, clinical scores) further consolidates the dominance of OS-positive regimens and signals stronger sequencing into HIF-2–based strategies—pressure points for avelumab+axitinib given its lack of proven OS benefit. For Bavencio+Inlyta, the immediate implications are: (1) reduced 1L addressable pool as perioperative IO expands; (2) heightened medical scrutiny on who benefits from dual ICI vs IO/TKI; (3) faster codification of post-IO standards that deprioritize re-use of axitinib-based IO within the same patient journey. Priority actions: (1) sharpen medical education on avelumab+axitinib’s practical advantages and center familiarity while transparently addressing OS data; (2) engage KOLs on selection/monitoring paradigms (IMDC vs Meet-URO, ctDNA-MRD) to define where axitinib-based IO can be viably chosen; (3) prepare scientific narrative for the HIF-2α era (sequencing after IO/TKI) and implications for ongoing RWE generation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview\nContext current as of January 2025. Verify critical details with latest NCCN/ESMO guidelines.\n\n### 1.1 Current Treatment Paradigm in Renal Cancer\n- Guidelines (1L metastatic ccRCC):\n  - Preferred IO/TKI doublets with OS benefit: pembrolizumab+axitinib, nivolumab+cabozantinib, pembrolizumab+lenvatinib (NCCN Cat. 1; guideline-preferred in ESMO).\n  - Ipilimumab+nivolumab: category-1 across IMDC risks based on durable OS tail and long-term follow-up.\n  - Avelumab+axitinib: approved but without statistically significant OS advantage vs sunitinib (JAVELIN Renal 101). NCCN lists as Other Recommended (Cat. 2A), and ESMO does not recommend it over OS-positive alternatives.\n- Sequencing (post-IO/TKI):\n  - VEGF TKIs (cabozantinib, tivozanib), lenvatinib+everolimus, and HIF-2α inhibitors (belzutifan) are central options after PD-(L)1 exposure, with class momentum in late lines.\n- Perioperative setting:\n  - Adjuvant pembrolizumab remains standard in high-risk resected ccRCC with strengthening long-term follow-up; ongoing trials (e.g., RAMPART) inform broader adjuvant ICI context.\n- Where avelumab+axitinib fits:\n  - Retains a niche within centers/payers standardized on axitinib and in scenarios prioritizing operational familiarity and flexible dose modification; not guideline-preferred where OS-positive doublets are available/covered.\n\n### 1.2 Approved Competitive Drugs\n- IO/TKI doublets with OS benefit (FDA/EMA): pembrolizumab+axitinib, nivolumab+cabozantinib, pembrolizumab+lenvatinib.\n- Dual ICI: nivolumab+ipilimumab (1L across risks).\n- VEGF TKIs: cabozantinib, axitinib, tivozanib; TKI+everolimus (lenvatinib+everolimus) for post-IO/TKI.\n- HIF-2α inhibitors:\n  - Belzutifan: US approval (Dec 2023) post-PD-(L)1 and VEGF TKI; EU conditional approval (Feb 2025) in advanced ccRCC after ≥2 lines (post PD-(L)1 and ≥2 VEGF TKIs) and for VHL-associated tumors—cementing HIF-2α adoption in Europe.\n- Regulatory dynamics 2024–2025:\n  - No approvals altered the 1L metastatic landscape; belzutifan’s EU move accelerates late-line class uptake but does not change 1L choices.\n\n### 1.3 EMD Serono’s Competitive Position\n- Relative standing:\n  - Avelumab+axitinib is clinically active but lacks an OS advantage vs sunitinib, constraining its guideline positioning vs pembrolizumab-based doublets and nivolumab+cabozantinib.\n- Differentiators to emphasize:\n  - Axitinib operational familiarity and dose-modulation; potential tolerability profiles and management pathways familiar to centers; payer contracting/total cost in select markets.\n- Competitive threats:\n  - Entrenched OS-positive 1L doublets (pembro- or cabo-based) dominate share.\n  - Late-line consolidation around HIF-2α combinations (e.g., belzutifan backbones) may standardize sequencing that bypasses or diminishes appetite for switching within axitinib-based IO regimens.\n  - Response-adapted and biomarker-informed strategies (e.g., ctDNA-MRD dynamics, clinical scores like Meet-URO) could steer first choice toward regimens with validated OS and robust translational frameworks, further narrowing avelumab+axitinib’s eligible population.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

These trends further disadvantage avelumab+axitinib’s share unless offset by targeted medical education, RWE subgroup positioning, and payer-operational levers.\n\n### 2.2 High-Priority Competitor Studies\n1. LBA95 Neoadjuvant immunotherapy in locally advanced ccRCC (NESCIO)\n   - Investigators: Femke Burgers — Netherlands Cancer Institute\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, Proffered Paper (LBA)\n   - Strategic Relevance: Perioperative IO expansion can shrink the 1L metastatic pool and creates earlier IO exposure that shapes downstream resistance biology. Reinforces the need for an avelumab+axitinib narrative that clarifies when and why an axitinib-based IO/TKI is chosen in previously IO-exposed populations entering metastatic care.\n\n2. 2596MO Ipilimumab + Nivolumab + Ciforadenant in 1L advanced RCC\n   - Investigators: Kathryn Beckermann — Greco-Hainsworth Center (Nashville)\n   - Session: 10/17/2025, Mini Oral\n   - Strategic Relevance: Adenosine A2a blockade as triplet intensification could address primary IO resistance. If activity and tolerability are favorable, academic centers may push triplets in 1L, eroding doublet share and heightening the bar versus avelumab+axitinib.\n\n3. 2613MO Biomarkers of response to 1L Nivolumab+Ipilimumab (COSMIC-313 correlative)\n   - Investigators: Berkay Simsek — Brigham & Women’s, Harvard Med\n   - Session: 10/19/2025, Mini Oral\n   - Strategic Relevance: Biomarker-guided selection (within a triplet-trial cohort) can refine who benefits from dual ICI vs intensified regimens. This undercuts empiric use of non-OS-proven doublets and supports data-driven preference for OS-positive backbones.\n\n4. 2615P Belzutifan + Lenvatinib (LITESPARK-010 Cohort 1 update; China)\n   - Investigators: Xinan Sheng — Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: HIF-2α combos are maturing post-IO, poised to standardize late-line sequencing. As HIF-2α regimens harden, there will be less rationale to cycle back to axitinib+PD-L1 in later lines, impacting lifecycle options for avelumab+axitinib.\n\n5. 2623P Cadonilimab + Lenvatinib after prior IO (CLEAR-IT Phase II)\n   - Investigators: Jiwei Huang — Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Demonstrates the appetite for IO/TKI beyond first line, potentially with alternate IO modalities. As post-IO efficacy becomes achievable, first-line regimens without OS advantage may face even greater scrutiny.\n\n6. 2681eP Real-world IO-based combinations in int/poor-risk nccRCC (ARON-1)\n   - Investigators: Matteo Rosellini — Univ. of Bologna\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, ePoster\n   - Strategic Relevance: IO-combo expansion into nccRCC consolidates familiarity with PD-1/TKI playbooks across histologies. The rising baseline of IO-combo literacy further concentrates 1L choices around OS-proven doublets.\n\n7. 2659eP KEYNOTE-564 selection criteria in real-life adjuvant setting\n   - Investigators: Selcuk Erdem — Istanbul University\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, ePoster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Validates pragmatic adjuvant selection, supporting broad PD-1 uptake post-nephrectomy. Downstream effect: more patients enter metastatic disease with prior IO exposure, affecting 1L choices and shrinking the pool for avelumab+axitinib.\n\n8. 2672eP Adjuvant pembrolizumab real-world outcomes (ARON-1)\n   - Investigators: Veronica Mollica — Univ. of Bologna\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, ePoster\n   - Strategic Relevance: RWE outcomes anchor adjuvant PD-1 as a durable standard. Medical Affairs must address the rising reality of IO-pretreated metastatic presentations when discussing 1L regimen selection.\n\n9. 2660eP Dynamic ctDNA-MRD monitoring under TKI + PD-1 therapy\n   - Investigators: Jiwei Huang — Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, ePoster\n   - Strategic Relevance: If validated, MRD-guided adaptation could favor regimens with OS proof and strong depth of response characteristics. Without OS data, avelumab+axitinib may be less competitive in MRD-driven algorithms.\n\n10. 2634P PD-1 + TKI remodeling of the TME (advanced RCC)\n    - Investigators: Liangyou Gu — PLA General Hospital, Beijing\n    - Session: 10/18/2025, Poster\n    - Strategic Relevance: Mechanistic data reinforcing IO/TKI synergy supports current OS-positive doublets; strengthens the rationale behind competitor backbones favored by guidelines.\n\n11. 2645P Meet-URO Score in 1L Immune-Combinations (prognostic performance)\n    - Investigators: Sara Elena Rebuzzi — Savona, Italy\n    - Session: 10/18/2025, Poster\n    - Strategic Relevance: Alternative risk tools may outperform or complement IMDC for selecting IO doublets. Could steer clinicians toward more prognostically appropriate OS-positive regimens over non-OS-proven options.\n\n12. 2635P Optimal IO duration in responders (beyond two years?)\n    - Investigators: Alexander Decruyenaere — Ghent Univ. Hospital\n    - Session: 10/18/2025, Poster\n    - Strategic Relevance: Duration policies affect toxicity, quality of life, and cost. Explicit discussions of stopping rules benefit regimens with robust OS data; lack of OS in avelumab+axitinib complicates long-duration justification.\n\n### 2.3 Emerging Threats and Novel Approaches\n1. 2596MO Ipilimumab+Nivolumab+Ciforadenant — Triplet intensification\n   - Phase: Phase 1b/2\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Adenosine-axis blockade may convert IO-resistant tumors, encouraging academic centers to escalate beyond doublets and diminish doublet market share.\n\n2. 2615P Belzutifan+Lenvatinib — HIF-2α combo post-IO\n   - Phase: Not stated in title (cohort update)\n   - Why This Is a Threat: HIF-2α + TKI could set a new late-line standard; with credible post-IO activity, it reduces appetite to recycle axitinib+PD-L1 later.\n\n3. 2623P Cadonilimab+Lenvatinib — IO/TKI after IO failure\n   - Phase: Phase II\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Validates sustained IO/TKI utility beyond 1L; erodes rationale for first-line regimens without OS superiority if effective alternatives exist later.\n\n4. 2660eP ctDNA-MRD under TKI+PD-1 — Response-adapted care\n   - Phase: Correlative ePoster\n   - Why This Is a Threat: MRD-driven decisions could preferentially reward regimens with established OS and deep responses, disadvantaging avelumab+axitinib.\n\n5. 2593MO LAG3 expression and IO response — Biomarker stratification\n   - Phase: Translational, Mini Oral\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Emerging biomarkers may guide therapy choice toward specific IO backbones, further concentrating use on OS-validated regimens.\n\n6. 2634P PD-1+TKI TME remodeling — Mechanistic support\n   - Phase: Translational\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Reinforces the biological rationale behind guideline-preferred IO/TKI standards, making non-OS-proven variants less compelling.\n\n7. 44eP Nano-immunotherapy (adaptive/innate) — Novel modality\n   - Phase: Preclinical ePoster\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Signals next-wave IO modalities; while early, such platforms could leapfrog current doublets in future trials.\n\n8. 1530P NUC-7738 + PD-1 (organoids) — Preclinical synergy\n   - Phase: Preclinical\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Adds to the pipeline of IO-sensitizing agents; raises the bar for efficacy benchmarks in doublet backbones.\n\n### 2.4 Geographic and Institutional Patterns\n- Geographic Distribution:\n  - United States:\n    - Greco-Hainsworth Center (Nashville): 2596MO — 1L triplet (adenosine axis).\n    - Dana-Farber (Boston): 2601P — Cytokines in exceptional IO responders.\n    - Brigham & Women’s/Harvard (Boston): 2613MO — Biomarkers in 1L nivo+ipi.\n    - UC San Diego: 2593MO — LAG3 expression/IO response.\n    - UT Southwestern (Dallas): 44eP — Nano-immunotherapy platform.\n  - Europe:\n    - Netherlands Cancer Institute: LBA95 — Neoadjuvant IO (randomized).\n    - Ghent University Hospital: 2635P — IO duration beyond 2 years.\n    - Strasbourg Univ.

    "analysis": "# Competitive Intelligence Report: TGCT at ESMO 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\nESMO 2025 TGCT competitor activity centers on a single but strategically important update: 2-year results from the MOTION phase 3 trial for vimseltinib (2694P), reinforcing its newly established US/EU standard in symptomatic, unresectable TGCT. This extends the durability and safety narrative for the first TGCT-approved oral CSF1R inhibitor in both regions, shaping physician and payer expectations around long-term benefit and hepatic risk management. For EMD Serono/Merck KGaA’s pimicotinib (BTD, 2023), the bar to compete now clearly includes sustained PRO improvements (pain, function, stiffness), robust hepatic safety/monitoring data, and evidence of surgery avoidance and return-to-function. Priority actions: 1) sharpen a head-to-head scientific narrative vs vimseltinib on long-term PROs and hepatic safety; 2) intensify EU KOL engagement (notably German sarcoma centers) to accelerate pivotal read-outs and RWE; 3) deploy HEOR frameworks (durability, work/activity restoration, surgery deferral) aligned to payer decision needs.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview\nContext current as of January 2025. Verify critical details with latest NCCN/ESMO guidelines.\n\n### 1.1 Current Treatment Paradigm in TGCT\n- Guidelines and clinical practice:\n  - Localized/nodular TGCT: surgery remains first-line when feasible, often curative; repeat surgeries may be required for recurrences.\n  - Diffuse or anatomically unresectable disease: systemic CSF1R inhibition is the standard; close monitoring of hepatic function is fundamental.\n  - Historically, pexidartinib (US, 2019) established the systemic precedent but with a REMS due to hepatotoxicity.\n  - In 2025, vimseltinib became the first oral CSF1R inhibitor approved expressly for TGCT in both US (Feb 14, 2025) and EU (Aug 2025), with PRO-driven clinical benefit and objective tumor responses from MOTION. Anticipate guideline updates to reflect vimseltinib’s preferred status and specific monitoring.\n- Treatment sequence (typical):\n  - 1L: Surgery if resectable; otherwise, vimseltinib as the likely first systemic choice for symptomatic, unresectable disease.\n  - 2L+: Alternative CSF1R inhibitor in cases of intolerance or inadequate response (e.g., pexidartinib in US), clinical trials, and selective local measures for symptom control.\n  - Supportive care and rehabilitation remain core to restoring function and quality of life.\n- Where pimicotinib fits:\n  - Pimicotinib (selective CSF1R inhibitor; BTD 2023) is positioned to enter as a class competitor. Pivotal outcomes must demonstrate durable PRO benefit, favorable hepatic safety/monitoring, and surgery avoidance to earn guideline and payer preference. Depending on label and data strength, positioning could be 1L systemic or as an alternative within-class option (intolerance/non-response).\n\n### 1.2 Approved Competitive Drugs\n- TGCT-approved agents:\n  - Vimseltinib (ROMVIMZA): US FDA (Feb 2025) and EMA (Aug 2025) approvals for symptomatic TGCT not amenable to improvement with surgery, supported by MOTION (tumor response and PROs). Expected to be the preferred systemic agent given efficacy and liver-safety profile relative to pexidartinib.\n  - Pexidartinib (US, 2019): Approved for symptomatic TGCT not amenable to surgery; limited by REMS for hepatotoxicity. Uptake variable due to safety/monitoring requirements and access constraints; expect relegation to post-vimseltinib use.\n- Recent regulatory updates:\n  - Vimseltinib’s 2025 trans-Atlantic approvals broaden access and will catalyze swift migration to front-line systemic use.\n- EMD Serono/Merck KGaA oncology assets (contextual, not TGCT-approved but relevant for footprint/KOL networks):\n  - Pimicotinib (CSF1R inhibitor; BTD 2023) — primary TGCT asset in late-stage development.\n  - Avelumab (PD-L1 inhibitor), Tepotinib (MET inhibitor), Cetuximab (EGFR inhibitor) — establish broad oncology presence and field infrastructure that can be leveraged for TGCT KOL engagement, access strategy, and evidence-dissemination.\n\n### 1.3 EMD Serono/Merck KGaA's Competitive Position\n- Comparative positioning:\n  - Versus vimseltinib: Pimicotinib must match or exceed long-term durability (≥2 years), deliver compelling PRO improvements (pain/function/stiffness), and show a hepatic safety/monitoring profile that satisfies both clinicians and payers. Simplicity of monitoring and dosing convenience can be practical differentiators.\n  - Versus pexidartinib: Opportunity to differentiate on hepatic safety and patient-reported benefit; however, vimseltinib is now the benchmark for first choice.\n- Key clinical differentiators to pursue:\n  - Clear, sustained PRO benefit (validated instruments), functional restoration, and reduced need for surgery.\n  - Robust hepatic safety data with clear monitoring guidance; low discontinuation rates for LFT abnormalities.\n  - Durability beyond one year; time to next intervention; work and activity outcomes; patient preference.\n  - Pragmatic evidence (RWE, registries) reflecting community practice and diverse anatomies (knee/ankle/hand/hip).\n- Main competitive threats:\n  - Vimseltinib’s first-mover advantage plus maturing long-term data and rapid inclusion in guidelines and payer policies.\n  - Potential payer step therapy mandating vimseltinib before alternatives.\n  - Class commoditization risk if safety/PRO profiles are perceived as similar; need for distinctive HEOR and monitoring advantages.\n- Strategic enablers:\n  - Leverage avelumab/tepotinib/cetuximab field networks to accelerate TGCT KOL mapping, medical education, and access negotiation.\n  - Prioritize EU engagement (post-EMA approval of vimseltinib), particularly high-volume sarcoma centers, to seed pimicotinib trials and RWE.\n\n---\n\n## 2. ESMO 2025 Competitor Activity Analysis\n\n### 2.1 Competitor Presentation Volume and Focus\nAt ESMO 2025, the most prominent competitor regimens by presentation volume were:\n1. Vimseltinib: 1 studies\n\n1. Vimseltinib (Count: 1 studies)\n   - MOA Class: CSF1R inhibitor (oral)\n   - Development Phase: Phase 3 (long-term follow-up)\n   - Key Abstracts: 2694P\n   - Brief note: Two-year MOTION update reinforces durability and safety narrative.\n\nAnalysis:\n- MOA dominance: CSF1R inhibition remains the central systemic strategy in TGCT.\n- New entrants: None identified in this dataset; activity reflects consolidation around approved CSF1R therapy.\n- Evidence types: Long-term outcomes from a pivotal phase 3 — high relevance for guidelines and payers.\n- Strategic implications for EMD: Pimicotinib must meet an elevated evidence threshold on long-term PROs, durability, and hepatic safety; field queries will anchor on comparative class expectations shaped by MOTION.\n\n### 2.2 High-Priority Competitor Studies\n1. [2694P] Vimseltinib — Long-term efficacy and safety in TGCT: 2-year MOTION results\n   - Investigators: Sebastian Bauer — University Hospital Essen (German Cancer Consortium)\n   - Session: 10/20/2025 — Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance:\n     - Two-year follow-up likely underscores sustained symptom and functional benefit alongside ongoing hepatic safety monitoring expectations. With US/EU approvals in 2025, these data will reinforce vimseltinib’s first-line systemic positioning in guidelines and payer pathways.\n     - Raises the benchmark for pimicotinib’s pivotal package: EMD should be prepared to address durability of PROs, time to surgery, and LFT-related discontinuations. EU-based leadership (Essen) suggests strong European KOL advocacy; targeted engagement is warranted for post-ESMO debriefs and scientific exchange.\n\n### 2.3 Emerging Threats and Novel Approaches\nNot included — dataset reflects one CSF1R inhibitor presentation without distinct novel mechanisms.\n\n### 2.4 Geographic and Institutional Patterns\n- Geographic Distribution:\n  - United States: No TGCT competitor abstracts captured in this dataset.\n  - Europe: Germany — University Hospital Essen (German Cancer Consortium): long-term vimseltinib outcomes.\n  - Asia/China: No TGCT competitor abstracts captured in this dataset.\n  - Other regions: None identified.\n\n- Top KOLs (≥2 high-impact abstracts):\n  - None identified in this dataset (single abstract). Notable presenter: Sebastian Bauer — Essen, Germany (2694P).\n\n- Regional Patterns and Insights:\n  - Europe: ESMO platform and German sarcoma leadership spotlight EU adoption of vimseltinib; expect rapid guideline and payer alignment post-EMA approval.\n  - Implications for EMD: Prioritize German and broader EU sarcoma centers for pimicotinib investigator engagement, RWE network formation, and educational programs on CSF1R class differentiation and hepatic monitoring."

    "analysis": "# Competitive Intelligence Report: Merkel Cell at ESMO 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\nESMO 2025 Merkel Cell competitor activity centers on the first phase 3 adjuvant immunotherapy readout (STAMP; LBA56) and a trial-in-progress of chemo–immunotherapy in treatment-naive advanced disease (PANDORA; 1739eTiP). The spotlight on adjuvant pembrolizumab reinforces a shift of immunotherapy into perioperative pathways, with potential to expand the market while intensifying PD-1 vs PD-L1 competition; chemo–IO exploration in the frontline advanced setting could test the durability of IO monotherapy as the default. For Avelumab (Bavencio), the near-term risk is adjuvant standard-setting by STAMP and, longer term, erosion of IO monotherapy preference if chemo–IO gains traction. Medical Affairs priorities: 1) prepare an adjuvant-focused scientific response (cross-trial context, benefit–risk framing, and ADAM trial positioning), 2) strengthen US KOL engagement around cooperative-group data and EU engagement where chemo–IO strategies are emerging, and 3) deploy field insights capture on adjuvant adoption intent and frontline chemo–IO usage signals.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview\nContext current as of January 2025. Verify critical details with latest NCCN/ESMO guidelines.\n\n### 1.1 Current Treatment Paradigm in Merkel Cell\n- Guideline status:\n  - For unresectable regional or metastatic (stage III–IV) MCC not amenable to curative surgery/radiotherapy, anti–PD-(L)1 monotherapy is standard systemic therapy per NCCN v2.2025 and ESMO 2024.\n  - Preferred immunotherapies (NCCN v2.2025): avelumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, retifanlimab (Category 2A).\n  - For primary locally advanced disease not amenable to curative treatment, avelumab and pembrolizumab are preferred.\n  - Chemotherapy (typically platinum/etoposide-based) is reserved when PD-(L)1 therapy is contraindicated or after progression on PD-(L)1.\n  - Neoadjuvant nivolumab is “useful in certain circumstances” for resectable regional disease.\n- Typical sequence:\n  - 1L: PD-(L)1 monotherapy (avelumab/pembrolizumab/retifanlimab; nivolumab listed).\n  - 2L: Cytotoxic chemotherapy if IO-ineligible or after PD-(L)1 progression; clinical trial preferred.\n  - Perioperative: Adjuvant IO under active investigation (STAMP—pembrolizumab; ADAM—avelumab). Neoadjuvant IO supported by small-series data, not yet standard.\n- Where avelumab fits:\n  - A preferred anti–PD-L1 option across metastatic and primary locally advanced settings where systemic therapy is indicated.\n  - Potential expansion into adjuvant if ADAM is positive; will compete head-to-head with PD-1–based adjuvant strategies if STAMP is practice-changing.\n\n### 1.2 Approved Competitive Drugs\n- Currently approved agents for advanced MCC:\n  - Avelumab (Bavencio): First MCC approval (2017), accelerated approval in the US; authorized in the EU for metastatic MCC. Labeled for metastatic or recurrent locally advanced disease.\n  - Pembrolizumab (Keytruda): US accelerated approval (2018) for recurrent locally advanced or metastatic MCC.\n  - Retifanlimab-dlwr (Zynyz): US accelerated approval (March 2023) for metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC.\n- Regulatory dynamics (past 12–18 months):\n  - No new MCC-specific approvals reported. Accelerated approval status persists; confirmatory/phase 3 programs are key to conversion.\n  - KEYNOTE-913 (confirmatory phase 3 for 1L pembrolizumab) primary analysis reported in 2024 to support AA conversion.\n  - Regional label specifics vary; verify EU labels locally, as country-level access and reimbursement can diverge.\n\n### 1.3 EMD Serono's Competitive Position\n- Comparative position:\n  - Avelumab is an established PD-L1 backbone with durable responses in advanced MCC and broad guideline endorsement. Pembrolizumab (PD-1) is the most proximate competitor with similar class efficacy signals; retifanlimab is a newer PD-1 entrant with narrower familiarity.\n- Clinical differentiators:\n  - Class durability and tolerability profile consistent with PD-(L)1 standards; broad real-world adoption in advanced MCC; extensive global footprint and experience in MCC centers-of-excellence.\n  - Pending ADAM (adjuvant avelumab) may provide first PD-L1 perioperative data; differentiation in dosing logistics, infusion reactions, and safety nuances could matter if multiple adjuvant programs succeed.\n- Key competitive threats:\n  - Adjuvant PD-1 (STAMP) readout could establish a new standard and shape perioperative guidelines ahead of PD-L1 data.\n  - Combination strategies (dual checkpoint, LAG-3, or chemo–IO) could pressure 1L IO monotherapy if they demonstrate superior early response/depth or survival.\n  - Confirmation of PD-1 labels via phase 3 success (e.g., KEYNOTE-913) would strengthen competitor positioning for regulatory conversions and payer confidence.\n\n---\n\n## 2. ESMO 2025 Competitor Activity Analysis\n\n### 2.1 Competitor Presentation Volume and Focus\n1. Pembrolizumab (adjuvant) — STAMP (Count: 1 study)\n   - MOA Class: Anti–PD-1 monotherapy\n   - Development Phase: Phase 3\n   - Key Abstracts: LBA56\n   - Brief note: First phase 3 adjuvant MCC readout; potential standard-setting.\n\n2. Chemio-immunotherapy (naive advanced) — PANDORA (Count: 1 study)\n   - MOA Class: Chemo + ICI\n   - Development Phase: Phase 2 (trial-in-progress)\n   - Key Abstracts: 1739eTiP\n   - Brief note: Frontline combination exploration; may challenge IO-monotherapy default.\n\nAnalysis:\n- MOA classes dominating: Immuno-oncology remains central (monotherapy PD-1 in adjuvant; chemo–IO in 1L metastatic).\n- New entrants: The emergence of chemo–IO in frontline MCC is notable given historical reliance on IO monotherapy; signals intent to improve early response and disease control.\n- Strategic implications:\n  - Adjuvant PD-1 success would expand immunotherapy use earlier, intensifying competition for perioperative share and accelerating guideline updates.\n  - A credible chemo–IO signal could erode IO-monotherapy preference in advanced disease, prompting payer and KOL debate on incremental benefit vs toxicity.\n\n### 2.2 High-Priority Competitor Studies\n1. LBA56 — Pembrolizumab: ECOG-ACRIN EA6174 (STAMP): Surgically Treated Adjuvant Merkel Cell Carcinoma, Phase III\n   - Investigators: Janice M. Mehnert — Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health\n   - Session: 10/20/2025 — Proffered Paper (Late-Breaking)\n   - Strategic Relevance:\n     - This is the first randomized phase 3 adjuvant immunotherapy readout in MCC; if positive, it would likely set an adjuvant standard over observation and catalyze rapid NCCN/ESMO adoption.\n     - A perioperative shift would expand the treatable population and concentrate decision-making among surgical/derm-onc and radiation teams; readiness to position ongoing adjuvant PD-L1 research and weigh benefit–risk is essential.\n     - The cooperative-group provenance (ECOG-ACRIN) and LBA status amplify credibility and will influence US KOL sentiment and payer comfort around adjuvant IO in MCC.\n\n2. 1739eTiP — Chemio-immunotherapy in naive advanced MCC: Phase II PANDORA Trial (Trial-in-Progress)\n   - Investigators: Simone Oldani — Medical Oncology Department, Milan, Italy\n   - Session: 10/20/2025 — ePoster (Trial-in-Progress)\n   - Strategic Relevance:\n     - Signals a European-led push to test frontline chemo–IO in MCC; if effective, could re-open the debate on whether combinations improve early disease control over IO alone.\n     - Although no efficacy data are presented (TiP), the design direction is strategically important: potential for deeper responses in symptomatic/bulky disease, at the cost of added toxicity and logistics.\n     - Monitoring sites, accrual pace, and regimen composition will inform competitiveness versus current IO monotherapy standards and future combination strategies.\n\n### 2.4 Geographic and Institutional Patterns\nGeographic Distribution:\n- United States:\n  - NYU Langone Health (Perlmutter Cancer Center) — Adjuvant PD-1 phase 3 (STAMP; LBA56)\n- Europe:\n  - Milan, Italy (Medical Oncology Department) — Frontline chemo–IO, phase 2 TiP (PANDORA; 1739eTiP)\n- Asia/China:\n  - No MCC studies identified in this dataset\n- Other regions:\n  - No MCC studies identified in this dataset\n\nTop KOLs (≥2 high-impact abstracts):\n- None identified in this dataset\n\nRegional Patterns and Insights:\n- United States:\n  - Cooperative-group leadership (ECOG-ACRIN) driving adjuvant standard-setting; expect rapid US guideline and payer discussions if the adjuvant trial is positive.\n- Europe:\n  - Investigators exploring chemo–IO in frontline advanced MCC; indicates appetite for combination strategies to optimize early tumor control.\n- Strategic implications:\n  - Prioritize US engagement with surgical oncology, dermatologic oncology, and radiation oncology KOLs for adjuvant discussions; prepare medical education on patient selection and perioperative safety.\n  - In Europe, track chemo–IO adoption intent and institution-level protocols; gather insights on unmet needs in symptomatic/bulky disease where combinations may gain traction.\n  - Align global evidence generation to address comparative positioning versus adjuvant PD-1 and to clarify the role of IO monotherapy vs combinations in frontline advanced MCC."
