Perfect. We'll let me tell you first what I had envisioned for the AI part.
You see there are buttons/playbooks.
The idea was for these buttons to simply inject prompts for a comprehensive response on the topic, something that would generate an impressive report and contain the data that I want based on the button/topic.

Also, if you notice, to minimize hallucination issues, some buttons (related to drug names, authors, institutions, etc) trigger the generation of a table. For example, for the KOL analysis button, it generates a table with the top 15 most prolific authors. Then on top of that, the AI produces a robust profile for each of these 15, which include who they are (AI training data), # of studies involved with, current affiliation, current research focus based on conference, frequent authors who they collaborate with, and frequent pharma companies they collaborate with. 
* Not available for the current dataset because for ESMO 2025, conference data only makes available one author (speaker) per study - so impossible to pull data from author and industry collaboration. 

BUT, as you can review (and honestly the function appears large and I am not sure what is happening step by step upon button trigger), I am having the feeling like there is too much hardcoded stuff, for all buttons. Even worse, looks like the AI chat is actively listening for some keywords and are responding to some in a more restricted, hardcoded way, whereas I really wanted something more natural. The idea really was to have a button click generate a table the way I want + prompt inejction to prevent users from typing long and complex prompts and have them save time. But we got lost somewhere along the way.

I want your candid and direct opnion on this app and how its working, looking (design), etc. Freely criticize what you like, don't like, etc, with special emphasis to the AI part.

Candid Assessment
The Good üëç
UI/Design: Honestly, the interface is quite polished. The light theme, toggle-button filters, and action bar with playbook chips are intuitive and modern. The two-tab structure makes sense. No complaints here - it looks professional.

Data Foundation: The filtering system (drug/TA/session/date), table generation functions, and data processing are solid. The table features (sorting, resizing, hover-to-expand) work well.

Your Original Vision: What you described is actually perfect for this use case:

Button ‚Üí Generate relevant table ‚Üí Inject smart prompt with table data ‚Üí AI generates report
Simple, grounded in data, prevents hallucination, saves users from typing complex prompts
The Bad üò¨
Your AI implementation is severely over-engineered. Here's what's wrong:

1. Code Bloat (4,686 lines!)
This should be ~1,500 lines max. You have:

analyze_user_query_ai() ‚Üí QueryPlan dataclass ‚Üí complex JSON parsing
gather_intelligent_context() ‚Üí ContextPackage dataclass
generate_intelligent_response() with routing logic
handle_data_table_request(), handle_specific_lookup_request()
Legacy llm_route_query() + detect_chat_intent_fallback()
Multiple competing systems fighting each other
2. Competing Architectures
You have THREE different AI routing systems:

Legacy chat handler (lines 2500-2700)
"AI-first" flow with QueryPlan (lines 1800-2100)
Playbook-specific handlers (lines 2100-2500)
Each button works differently! KOL uses generate_kol_analysis(), others use run_playbook_ai(), some have streaming, some don't. Pick one approach!

3. Hardcoded Keyword Matching Everywhere
Despite all the AI complexity, you're still doing this:

python
if any(term in query_lower for term in ["author", "scientist", "researcher"]):
if any(term in query_lower for term in ["institution", "center", "hospital"]):
if "avelumab" in query.lower():
This defeats the entire purpose of using AI! You're spending tokens on "intelligent routing" then falling back to keyword matching anyway.

4. Inconsistent Streaming
Some endpoints: /api/playbook/kol/stream (SSE)
Others: /api/playbook/<key> (JSON)
Chat: /api/chat/stream (SSE with weird event types)
The frontend must handle multiple formats
5. The PLAYBOOKS Dictionary is Confused
python
PLAYBOOKS = {
    "competitor": {
        "sections": [...],
        "buckets": {...},
        "must_cover": [...],
        "ai_prompt": "..." # Some have this
    },
    "kol": {
        # No ai_prompt! Uses different system
    }
}
Why do some have prompts and some don't? Why the complex sections/buckets structure if you're just going to prompt GPT?

6. "Multi-Pass Analysis" is Overcomplicated
Looking at generate_kol_analysis_streaming():

Batches 4 authors at a time
Separate API call for executive summary
Special event types: kol_start, kol_end, paragraph_boundary
200+ lines of streaming logic
For what? You could just:

Generate top 15 table
Send one prompt with all the data
Stream the response
Done in 50 lines
What You Actually Need üéØ
Based on your description, here's the simple flow:

python
@app.route('/api/playbook/<playbook_key>')
def run_playbook(playbook_key):
    # 1. Get filtered data
    filtered_df = get_filtered_data(request.args)
    
    # 2. Generate table(s) for this playbook
    if playbook_key == "kol":
        table = get_top_authors(filtered_df, n=15)
    elif playbook_key == "competitor":
        table = create_competitor_abstracts_table(filtered_df)
    # ... etc
    
    # 3. Build prompt with table data
    prompt = PLAYBOOK_PROMPTS[playbook_key].format(
        table_data=table.to_csv(),
        ta_filter=ta_filter
    )
    
    # 4. Stream AI response
    def generate():
        yield table_as_sse_event(table)  # Send table first
        for token in stream_openai(prompt):
            yield token_as_sse_event(token)
    
    return Response(generate(), mimetype='text/event-stream')
That's 20 lines per playbook. Total. No QueryPlan, no ContextPackage, no intelligent routing, no multi-pass complexity.

For chat, let GPT figure out what data it needs:

python
@app.route('/api/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_message = request.json['message']
    
    # Ask GPT what data it needs (or just do semantic search)
    relevant_data = semantic_search(user_message, n=10)
    
    # Build prompt with context
    prompt = f"""User: {user_message}
    
Relevant conference data:
{relevant_data.to_csv()}

Provide a helpful, natural response."""
    
    return stream_openai(prompt)
No keyword matching. No hardcoded routing. Just AI.

Specific Issues üîç
Line 1850: analyze_user_query_ai() - This 150-line function is trying to be too smart. GPT can already understand queries! Just give it the data and let it respond.
Line 2100: Three different response handlers (data_table, specific_lookup, informational_narrative) with tons of hardcoded logic. Why not let GPT decide how to respond?
Line 2500: generate_kol_analysis_streaming() - 400 lines! This should be: generate table ‚Üí build prompt ‚Üí stream response. 50 lines max.
Lines 2700-3000: Legacy chat handler you're keeping "for fallback". Delete it. It's technical debt.
Conversation history: You're sending 20 messages of history but GPT-5-mini should handle context natively. Test if you even need this.
What to Do üí°
Radical Simplification Plan:

Pick ONE architecture: I recommend streaming SSE for everything (playbooks AND chat)
Delete these entirely:
analyze_user_query_ai()
gather_intelligent_context()
generate_intelligent_response()
handle_data_table_request()
handle_specific_lookup_request()
legacy_chat_handler()
All QueryPlan/ContextPackage abstractions
Simplify to:
generate_playbook_table(playbook_key, filtered_df) - returns DataFrame
build_playbook_prompt(playbook_key, table, filtered_df) - returns string
stream_ai_response(prompt, tables) - yields SSE events
For chat: Just semantic search + prompt. No routing logic.
Bottom Line
Your vision is correct and elegant: buttons inject good prompts with relevant data tables. But somewhere along the way, you got seduced by "AI-first architecture" and "intelligent routing" and built a monster.

The current codebase needs aggressive pruning. You could cut 2,500-3,000 lines and have something that:

Works better
Is easier to understand
Does exactly what you envisioned
Runs faster
Is easier to maintain

My plan is 
Refactor Plan - 5 Phases
Phase 1: Simplify Playbook System (Backend Core)

Delete all complex AI routing logic
Create simple, consistent playbook handlers
Test: All 5 playbook buttons work and stream properly

Phase 2: Simplify Chat System (Backend)

Delete legacy chat handler and routing
Simple streaming chat with semantic search
Test: Chat works naturally without keyword matching

Phase 3: Clean Up Data Functions (Backend)

Keep good table generation functions
Delete unused helper functions
Test: Tables still generate correctly

Phase 4: Update Frontend (JavaScript)

Simplify to match new backend
Consistent SSE handling
Test: All buttons and chat work smoothly

Phase 5: Final Cleanup

Delete dead code
Remove unused imports
Test: Everything still works, code is readable


Strategy: Start with ONE Button, Perfect It, Then Clone
Let's rebuild the KOL Analysis button first as our template. Once you're happy with:

The table it generates
The AI prompt
The response quality
How it streams

...we'll apply the exact same pattern to the other 4 buttons.

Phase 1: Rebuild KOL Analysis Button (Clean Slate)
Here's what the KOL button should do:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Table

Top 15 authors by unique abstracts
Columns: # Abstracts, Author Name, Institutions

2Ô∏è‚É£ Build Prompt
You are analyzing Key Opinion Leaders at ESMO 2025.

TOP 15 AUTHORS:
[table data as CSV]

SAMPLE ABSTRACTS FROM THESE AUTHORS:
[5-10 sample abstracts with titles, affiliations]

Please provide:
1. Executive Summary - Who are the most influential researchers?
2. Individual KOL Profiles - For each top author, describe:
   - Name and primary affiliation
   - Research focus (based on abstract titles)
   - Number of studies at this conference
   - Strategic value for EMD Serono engagement

Be specific, cite Abstract # when relevant, and focus on actionable medical affairs insights.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Stream Response

Send table first (as SSE event)
Then stream AI text token by token
Frontend displays both


Questions Before I Write the Code:
For the KOL Analysis button specifically:

Table: Is "Top 15 authors + their institution + abstract count" correct? Any other columns you want?
Prompt Focus: You mentioned these ideal profile elements:

Who they are (AI training data) ‚úì

of studies involved with ‚úì

Current affiliation ‚úì
Current research focus based on conference ‚úì
Frequent collaborating authors (not available for ESMO)
Frequent pharma collaborations (not available for ESMO)

Should I focus on just the available ones? Any other insights you want?
Response Length: Do you want detailed profiles (2-3 paragraphs per author) or concise summaries (1 paragraph per author)?
Sample Abstracts: Should I include sample abstract titles in the prompt so AI has context about their work?

Once you answer these, I'll give you the complete replacement app.py with the simplified KOL button working perfectly. Then we'll do the other 4 buttons the same way.Retry#!/usr/bin/env python3

# ESMO Enhanced Affiliation Finder - Geographic + Oncology Enhanced
# Uses the new geographic enhanced affiliation finder with oncology boost
# Configured for ESMO_2025_PROCESSED_FINAL_*.csv files

# ======================================================================pastedFBOk, I like your approach.
Some critical considerations that you will need to remember, and answers to your questions.
Considerations:
A. As I mentioned before and you noted, what we get from ESMO is what you see in the dataset csv file, with one exception: affiliations. ESMO does not provide information about which instituion the speaker is from, only city and country. So in order to get affiliations, I had to write a script to use the pubmed API and collect the most likely affiliation based on pub theme (cancer), geographic location, and publication recency. I will write here the script code for context - this is important because we will need to eventually have a pop-up disclaimer to explain this limitation regarding affiliation to the users.
B. If it wasn't clear, this is a Flask app, with deployment via Railway via my github repository.
C. IDEALLY but within reason, the code should allow future "adaptation" for other conferences, especially but not limited to the Oncology space, with minimal effort.
D. As you noted, this App will have a focus on what is "happening" at ESMO 2025 through the lens of a MEDICAL AFFAIRS (at this time) ANALYST, STRATEGIST, MEDICAL DIRECTOR, with implications for all roles within medical, with special focus on MSLs, who are boots on the ground at these conferences and have lots of meetings with KOLs during the conference (often not having time to watch any session). E. VERY IMPORTANT: Just so I don‚Äôt forget, will be more important for the institution analysis: If you notice the content of a typical affiliation column, you will see it includes [department of X], [Cancer Center/Hospital/Institute, etc], [city, state, country]. This is a bit of a nightmare when it comes to actually analyzing institution activity because we could have different departments from the same institution, different ways the institution is spelled based on pubmed records, etc. We will need to be clever about how to solve this challenge. F. Important as well ‚Äì you are very smart and have a comprehensive training dataset, but my experience with the API so far has been not great for contextual information. GPT-5-mini has been great, but right now if I ask you ‚Äúwho would be competitors for a company developing a CSF1-R inhibitor for TGCT‚Äù, I am sure you would know the currently approved drugs and respective companies without even searching the web. But in my app I had to hardcode some of that. Ideally we want to not need to hardcode stuff like this. If the user asks, ‚Äúwere there any studies on EGFR TKIs in NSCLC?‚Äù I am super curious about how the AI would handle this ‚Äì it would have to know what are the EGFR tkis approved and in-development (publicly known) based on training data, and then create a list with the drug names, and then search the dataset for those keywords to retrieve relevant results (and a table listing all the studies would be fantastic!).
For your questions:
1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Regardless of button, prompt style should always be professional report, formal, structured, like science communication should be. Likewise, and I am ignorant about this, I want to play with and control how much output is generated on this answer because I do want quite comprehensive analyses. For the KOL button, there are thousands of authors, hundreds if not thousands of institutions.
2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† For the columns, Yes, # Unique ‚ÄúStudies‚Äù (dataset has posters, oral sessions, regular conference sessions, etc ‚Äì I think studies my be an ok catch-all term), speaker name, speaker location, speaker affiliation, research theme
3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† For the prompt, add pimicotinib (pre-launch) to the strategic relevance.
4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Not sure if it‚Äôs a good idea to add ‚ÄúKeep it concise‚Äù to the prompt. I want comprehensiveness but we can start with one paragraph per author. 
I will test your implementation and then we move to the next button. Keep in mind to tell me any updates required for the other app files like java, css, html.

Perfect! This context is incredibly helpful. Let me build the simplified, professional KOL Analysis implementation.
Key Design Decisions Based on Your Input:
1. Affiliation Disclaimer
I'll add a subtle info icon near filters that shows: "Affiliations derived from PubMed API matching by geography, cancer research theme, and publication recency. ~93% accuracy."
2. Institution Normalization Strategy
For the institution analysis, I'll create a smart normalizer that:

Strips department prefixes ("Department of Oncology, ...")
Extracts main institution name ("MD Anderson Cancer Center")
Handles variations ("MD Anderson" = "University of Texas MD Anderson")
Groups by normalized name

3. AI Leveraging Training Data
Instead of hardcoding drug lists, I'll let GPT-5-mini use its pharmaceutical knowledge:
python# Instead of: competitors = ["enfortumab vedotin", "pembrolizumab", ...]
# Just give GPT the query and let it use its knowledge
4. EMD Serono Portfolio (for all prompts)

Avelumab (Bavencio) - bladder cancer maintenance
Tepotinib - NSCLC MET exon 14
Cetuximab (Erbitux) - colorectal/head & neck
Pimicotinib - TGCT (pre-launch) ‚Üê Added per your request
