The collective emphasis on PD-1/TKI biology, adjuvant utilization, and response-adapted tools (ctDNA-MRD, clinical scores) further consolidates the dominance of OS-positive regimens and signals stronger sequencing into HIF-2–based strategies—pressure points for avelumab+axitinib given its lack of proven OS benefit. For Bavencio+Inlyta, the immediate implications are: (1) reduced 1L addressable pool as perioperative IO expands; (2) heightened medical scrutiny on who benefits from dual ICI vs IO/TKI; (3) faster codification of post-IO standards that deprioritize re-use of axitinib-based IO within the same patient journey. Priority actions: (1) sharpen medical education on avelumab+axitinib’s practical advantages and center familiarity while transparently addressing OS data; (2) engage KOLs on selection/monitoring paradigms (IMDC vs Meet-URO, ctDNA-MRD) to define where axitinib-based IO can be viably chosen; (3) prepare scientific narrative for the HIF-2α era (sequencing after IO/TKI) and implications for ongoing RWE generation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape Overview\nContext current as of January 2025. Verify critical details with latest NCCN/ESMO guidelines.\n\n### 1.1 Current Treatment Paradigm in Renal Cancer\n- Guidelines (1L metastatic ccRCC):\n  - Preferred IO/TKI doublets with OS benefit: pembrolizumab+axitinib, nivolumab+cabozantinib, pembrolizumab+lenvatinib (NCCN Cat. 1; guideline-preferred in ESMO).\n  - Ipilimumab+nivolumab: category-1 across IMDC risks based on durable OS tail and long-term follow-up.\n  - Avelumab+axitinib: approved but without statistically significant OS advantage vs sunitinib (JAVELIN Renal 101). NCCN lists as Other Recommended (Cat. 2A), and ESMO does not recommend it over OS-positive alternatives.\n- Sequencing (post-IO/TKI):\n  - VEGF TKIs (cabozantinib, tivozanib), lenvatinib+everolimus, and HIF-2α inhibitors (belzutifan) are central options after PD-(L)1 exposure, with class momentum in late lines.\n- Perioperative setting:\n  - Adjuvant pembrolizumab remains standard in high-risk resected ccRCC with strengthening long-term follow-up; ongoing trials (e.g., RAMPART) inform broader adjuvant ICI context.\n- Where avelumab+axitinib fits:\n  - Retains a niche within centers/payers standardized on axitinib and in scenarios prioritizing operational familiarity and flexible dose modification; not guideline-preferred where OS-positive doublets are available/covered.\n\n### 1.2 Approved Competitive Drugs\n- IO/TKI doublets with OS benefit (FDA/EMA): pembrolizumab+axitinib, nivolumab+cabozantinib, pembrolizumab+lenvatinib.\n- Dual ICI: nivolumab+ipilimumab (1L across risks).\n- VEGF TKIs: cabozantinib, axitinib, tivozanib; TKI+everolimus (lenvatinib+everolimus) for post-IO/TKI.\n- HIF-2α inhibitors:\n  - Belzutifan: US approval (Dec 2023) post-PD-(L)1 and VEGF TKI; EU conditional approval (Feb 2025) in advanced ccRCC after ≥2 lines (post PD-(L)1 and ≥2 VEGF TKIs) and for VHL-associated tumors—cementing HIF-2α adoption in Europe.\n- Regulatory dynamics 2024–2025:\n  - No approvals altered the 1L metastatic landscape; belzutifan’s EU move accelerates late-line class uptake but does not change 1L choices.\n\n### 1.3 EMD Serono’s Competitive Position\n- Relative standing:\n  - Avelumab+axitinib is clinically active but lacks an OS advantage vs sunitinib, constraining its guideline positioning vs pembrolizumab-based doublets and nivolumab+cabozantinib.\n- Differentiators to emphasize:\n  - Axitinib operational familiarity and dose-modulation; potential tolerability profiles and management pathways familiar to centers; payer contracting/total cost in select markets.\n- Competitive threats:\n  - Entrenched OS-positive 1L doublets (pembro- or cabo-based) dominate share.\n  - Late-line consolidation around HIF-2α combinations (e.g., belzutifan backbones) may standardize sequencing that bypasses or diminishes appetite for switching within axitinib-based IO regimens.\n  - Response-adapted and biomarker-informed strategies (e.g., ctDNA-MRD dynamics, clinical scores like Meet-URO) could steer first choice toward regimens with validated OS and robust translational frameworks, further narrowing avelumab+axitinib’s eligible population.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

These trends further disadvantage avelumab+axitinib’s share unless offset by targeted medical education, RWE subgroup positioning, and payer-operational levers.\n\n### 2.2 High-Priority Competitor Studies\n1. LBA95 Neoadjuvant immunotherapy in locally advanced ccRCC (NESCIO)\n   - Investigators: Femke Burgers — Netherlands Cancer Institute\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, Proffered Paper (LBA)\n   - Strategic Relevance: Perioperative IO expansion can shrink the 1L metastatic pool and creates earlier IO exposure that shapes downstream resistance biology. Reinforces the need for an avelumab+axitinib narrative that clarifies when and why an axitinib-based IO/TKI is chosen in previously IO-exposed populations entering metastatic care.\n\n2. 2596MO Ipilimumab + Nivolumab + Ciforadenant in 1L advanced RCC\n   - Investigators: Kathryn Beckermann — Greco-Hainsworth Center (Nashville)\n   - Session: 10/17/2025, Mini Oral\n   - Strategic Relevance: Adenosine A2a blockade as triplet intensification could address primary IO resistance. If activity and tolerability are favorable, academic centers may push triplets in 1L, eroding doublet share and heightening the bar versus avelumab+axitinib.\n\n3. 2613MO Biomarkers of response to 1L Nivolumab+Ipilimumab (COSMIC-313 correlative)\n   - Investigators: Berkay Simsek — Brigham & Women’s, Harvard Med\n   - Session: 10/19/2025, Mini Oral\n   - Strategic Relevance: Biomarker-guided selection (within a triplet-trial cohort) can refine who benefits from dual ICI vs intensified regimens. This undercuts empiric use of non-OS-proven doublets and supports data-driven preference for OS-positive backbones.\n\n4. 2615P Belzutifan + Lenvatinib (LITESPARK-010 Cohort 1 update; China)\n   - Investigators: Xinan Sheng — Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: HIF-2α combos are maturing post-IO, poised to standardize late-line sequencing. As HIF-2α regimens harden, there will be less rationale to cycle back to axitinib+PD-L1 in later lines, impacting lifecycle options for avelumab+axitinib.\n\n5. 2623P Cadonilimab + Lenvatinib after prior IO (CLEAR-IT Phase II)\n   - Investigators: Jiwei Huang — Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, Poster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Demonstrates the appetite for IO/TKI beyond first line, potentially with alternate IO modalities. As post-IO efficacy becomes achievable, first-line regimens without OS advantage may face even greater scrutiny.\n\n6. 2681eP Real-world IO-based combinations in int/poor-risk nccRCC (ARON-1)\n   - Investigators: Matteo Rosellini — Univ. of Bologna\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, ePoster\n   - Strategic Relevance: IO-combo expansion into nccRCC consolidates familiarity with PD-1/TKI playbooks across histologies. The rising baseline of IO-combo literacy further concentrates 1L choices around OS-proven doublets.\n\n7. 2659eP KEYNOTE-564 selection criteria in real-life adjuvant setting\n   - Investigators: Selcuk Erdem — Istanbul University\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, ePoster\n   - Strategic Relevance: Validates pragmatic adjuvant selection, supporting broad PD-1 uptake post-nephrectomy. Downstream effect: more patients enter metastatic disease with prior IO exposure, affecting 1L choices and shrinking the pool for avelumab+axitinib.\n\n8. 2672eP Adjuvant pembrolizumab real-world outcomes (ARON-1)\n   - Investigators: Veronica Mollica — Univ. of Bologna\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, ePoster\n   - Strategic Relevance: RWE outcomes anchor adjuvant PD-1 as a durable standard. Medical Affairs must address the rising reality of IO-pretreated metastatic presentations when discussing 1L regimen selection.\n\n9. 2660eP Dynamic ctDNA-MRD monitoring under TKI + PD-1 therapy\n   - Investigators: Jiwei Huang — Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ\n   - Session: 10/18/2025, ePoster\n   - Strategic Relevance: If validated, MRD-guided adaptation could favor regimens with OS proof and strong depth of response characteristics. Without OS data, avelumab+axitinib may be less competitive in MRD-driven algorithms.\n\n10. 2634P PD-1 + TKI remodeling of the TME (advanced RCC)\n    - Investigators: Liangyou Gu — PLA General Hospital, Beijing\n    - Session: 10/18/2025, Poster\n    - Strategic Relevance: Mechanistic data reinforcing IO/TKI synergy supports current OS-positive doublets; strengthens the rationale behind competitor backbones favored by guidelines.\n\n11. 2645P Meet-URO Score in 1L Immune-Combinations (prognostic performance)\n    - Investigators: Sara Elena Rebuzzi — Savona, Italy\n    - Session: 10/18/2025, Poster\n    - Strategic Relevance: Alternative risk tools may outperform or complement IMDC for selecting IO doublets. Could steer clinicians toward more prognostically appropriate OS-positive regimens over non-OS-proven options.\n\n12. 2635P Optimal IO duration in responders (beyond two years?)\n    - Investigators: Alexander Decruyenaere — Ghent Univ. Hospital\n    - Session: 10/18/2025, Poster\n    - Strategic Relevance: Duration policies affect toxicity, quality of life, and cost. Explicit discussions of stopping rules benefit regimens with robust OS data; lack of OS in avelumab+axitinib complicates long-duration justification.\n\n### 2.3 Emerging Threats and Novel Approaches\n1. 2596MO Ipilimumab+Nivolumab+Ciforadenant — Triplet intensification\n   - Phase: Phase 1b/2\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Adenosine-axis blockade may convert IO-resistant tumors, encouraging academic centers to escalate beyond doublets and diminish doublet market share.\n\n2. 2615P Belzutifan+Lenvatinib — HIF-2α combo post-IO\n   - Phase: Not stated in title (cohort update)\n   - Why This Is a Threat: HIF-2α + TKI could set a new late-line standard; with credible post-IO activity, it reduces appetite to recycle axitinib+PD-L1 later.\n\n3. 2623P Cadonilimab+Lenvatinib — IO/TKI after IO failure\n   - Phase: Phase II\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Validates sustained IO/TKI utility beyond 1L; erodes rationale for first-line regimens without OS superiority if effective alternatives exist later.\n\n4. 2660eP ctDNA-MRD under TKI+PD-1 — Response-adapted care\n   - Phase: Correlative ePoster\n   - Why This Is a Threat: MRD-driven decisions could preferentially reward regimens with established OS and deep responses, disadvantaging avelumab+axitinib.\n\n5. 2593MO LAG3 expression and IO response — Biomarker stratification\n   - Phase: Translational, Mini Oral\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Emerging biomarkers may guide therapy choice toward specific IO backbones, further concentrating use on OS-validated regimens.\n\n6. 2634P PD-1+TKI TME remodeling — Mechanistic support\n   - Phase: Translational\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Reinforces the biological rationale behind guideline-preferred IO/TKI standards, making non-OS-proven variants less compelling.\n\n7. 44eP Nano-immunotherapy (adaptive/innate) — Novel modality\n   - Phase: Preclinical ePoster\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Signals next-wave IO modalities; while early, such platforms could leapfrog current doublets in future trials.\n\n8. 1530P NUC-7738 + PD-1 (organoids) — Preclinical synergy\n   - Phase: Preclinical\n   - Why This Is a Threat: Adds to the pipeline of IO-sensitizing agents; raises the bar for efficacy benchmarks in doublet backbones.\n\n### 2.4 Geographic and Institutional Patterns\n- Geographic Distribution:\n  - United States:\n    - Greco-Hainsworth Center (Nashville): 2596MO — 1L triplet (adenosine axis).\n    - Dana-Farber (Boston): 2601P — Cytokines in exceptional IO responders.\n    - Brigham & Women’s/Harvard (Boston): 2613MO — Biomarkers in 1L nivo+ipi.\n    - UC San Diego: 2593MO — LAG3 expression/IO response.\n    - UT Southwestern (Dallas): 44eP — Nano-immunotherapy platform.\n  - Europe:\n    - Netherlands Cancer Institute: LBA95 — Neoadjuvant IO (randomized).\n    - Ghent University Hospital: 2635P — IO duration beyond 2 years.\n    - Strasbourg Univ.
