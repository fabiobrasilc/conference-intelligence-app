    "analysis": "# Strategic Briefing: Lung Cancer — ESMO 2025\n\nPre-conference briefing (based on ESMO 2025 abstracts). Date: 14 Oct 2025. This is a PRE‑CONFERENCE intelligence synthesis to inform Medical Affairs, MSLs and leadership going into ESMO (Oct 17–21, 2025).\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nTepotinib (Tepmetko) enters ESMO 2025 with a strong, defensible position for MET exon 14 skipping (METex14) NSCLC: the VISION program’s long‑term follow‑up being presented at ESMO (1996P, 1995P) reinforces durable systemic responses and meaningful intracranial activity, and our plasma CDx pathway helps capture patients who are tissue‑challenged. However, the MET landscape at ESMO is active and fragmented: ADCs (telisotuzumab vedotin and new ADC designs), EGFR+MET combination strategies (savolitinib + osimertinib), bispecifics (amivantamab SC), and next‑generation MET TKIs are all presenting data that could change physician choice, diagnostic workflows and sequencing algorithms.\n\nThe most important ESMO 2025 items to watch (based on abstracts):\n- VISION 3‑year update (1996P/1995P): confirms durable responses and intracranial benefit with tepotinib, and shows stronger outcomes when used earlier (1L) — this is our central clinical differentiator.\n- SACHI/SAVANNAH program (1954P/1955P): ctDNA clearance and PFS signals for savolitinib+osimertinib vs chemotherapy, plus combination safety signals (edema, hepatotoxicity, VTE) — this shapes the EGFR+MET resistance niche.\n- Telisotuzumab vedotin (LUMINOSITY: 1948P/1951P/1950P): CDx (VENTANA MET SP44) concordance and toxicity-management data operationalize ADC adoption for c‑MET IHC‑high patients.\n- New MET TKIs / ADC innovations (928P DO‑2, 1946P MYTX‑011, KUNPENG vebreltinib): early signals of high ORR or differentiated tolerability that create medium‑term threats if confirmed.\n\nTop priorities for Medical Affairs during and after ESMO:\n- Protect and amplify Tepotinib’s differentiators (durability, intracranial activity, plasma CDx) in field messaging and payer conversations.\n- Rapidly equip MSLs with concrete comparator data (efficacy, DoR, intracranial outcomes, safety profiles and diagnostic criteria) and objection handling for ADCs, bispecifics and EGFR+MET combos.\n- Use ESMO momentum to accelerate pragmatic evidence generation: diagnostic harmonization work, prospective/observational ctDNA monitoring in METex14 patients, and real‑world sequencing datasets capturing post‑ADC/bispecific outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Pre‑ESMO 2025 Lung Cancer Landscape\n\n### Current Treatment Paradigm\n- Clinical context: METex14 skipping mutations occur in ~3–4% of NSCLC and represent a validated oncogenic driver. Current guideline practice places selective MET TKIs as the preferred targeted therapy for METex14.\n- Where Tepotinib fits: Tepotinib (Tepmetko) is an approved selective MET TKI for metastatic NSCLC with METex14. VISION (NCT02864992) is our core evidence base and is being highlighted at ESMO (1996P/1995P).\n- Key evidence supporting positioning:\n  - VISION 3‑year follow‑up (1996P): tissue‑positive cohort (n=208) ORR 54.8%, median DOR 17.4 months, mPFS 13.7 months, mOS 22.3 months; first‑line tissue‑positive subgroup (n=111) ORR 59.5%, mDOR 31.7 months.\n  - VISION sequencing analysis (1995P) shows superior durability when tepotinib is used earlier (1L ORR 57.9%, mDOR 31.7 months; 2L+ ORR 45.0%, mDOR 12.6 months).\n- Diagnostics and access: METex14 detection requires splice‑aware RNA/NGS or sensitive assays; VISION demonstrated use of tissue and liquid testing (tissue+/liquid+ subgroups). A plasma CDx pathway increases capture of patients who cannot undergo tissue biopsy, which supports uptake in real‑world settings.\n\n### Competitive Positioning\n- Strengths for Tepotinib\n  - Durable responses (VISION mDOR up to 31.7 months in 1L) and documented intracranial activity (VISION and REAL‑MET confirm intracranial responses).\n  - Established label for METex14 and availability of plasma CDx to identify patients.\n  - Familiar safety profile for clinicians (class AE profile: peripheral edema, mild hepatic effects); long‑term safety consistent with prior reports.\n- Key competitors and how they differ\n  - Capmatinib (GEOMETRY): validated TKI with strong ORR in 1L historically (reported ~68% in 1L cohorts), direct peer.\n  - Vebreltinib (bozitinib; KUNPENG): Phase II reports high ORR (75%), long DoR/mPFS (mDoR 15.9 mo; mPFS 14.1 mo) — strong regional competitor in China.\n  - Telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso‑V, AbbVie): ADC for c‑MET IHC‑high patients — ORR ~28.6% overall, higher in c‑MET high (~34.6%); has CDx (VENTANA MET SP44) and ADC‑specific toxicity (neuropathy, ocular) that influences sequencing and patient selection.\n  - Savolitinib + osimertinib: targeted EGFR+METamp resistance niche (SAVANNAH/SACHI): ctDNA clearance and PFS signals versus chemotherapy, creating a favored approach in MET‑amplified, EGFR‑mutant progression after osimertinib.\n  - Amivantamab (EGFR/MET bispecific): evolving SC formulation reduces infusion reactions; data in EGFR+MET contexts and practical prophylaxis strategies are being shared.\n  - New MET TKIs (DO‑2 deuterated MET inhibitor): early signs of activity and a different tolerability profile (notably less edema in early cohorts).\n- Market dynamics snapshot\n  - Tepotinib has a defensible position in METex14 via label and durability; however, ADCs and combination regimens create alternative pathways for MET‑altered patients (especially those selected by IHC or with EGFR co‑alterations). Rapid adoption of IHC CDx for ADCs and ctDNA guidance for combinations could fragment the MET patient flow.\n\n### Evidence Gaps and Unmet Needs\n- MET testing standardization: heterogeneous assays and cutoffs (RNA NGS for METex14 vs FISH/NGS quant for amplification vs IHC for protein OE) lead to inconsistent patient selection.\n- Sequencing evidence after ADCs/bispecifics: no prospective data define optimal sequencing (TKI → ADC → bispecific or ADC → TKI), particularly for METex14 patients who may be treated with ADCs because of IHC overlap.\n- CNS data beyond tepotinib: tepotinib shows intracranial responses (VISION, REAL‑MET), but prospective CNS endpoints for other MET agents are limited.\n- ctDNA as a routine early‑response tool: SACHI (1954P) supports ctDNA clearance as predictive — prospective trials tying ctDNA‑guided decisions to improved outcomes are lacking.\n- Elderly/ECOG≥2 and comorbidity populations: underrepresented in many trials; VISION included older patients but broader generalizability remains a question.\n\n---\n\n## What's Being Presented at ESMO 2025 in Lung Cancer\n\nBelow are the high‑priority abstracts that materially impact Tepotinib positioning. For regular abstracts we report the numbers as presented.\n\n### High‑Priority Studies (selected, with actionable implications)\n\n1) 1996P — VISION: Tepotinib 3‑year follow‑up in METex14 NSCLC (Phase II, NCT02864992)\n- Key data: tissue‑positive cohort (T+, n=208) ORR 54.8%; mDOR 17.4 months; mPFS 13.7 months; mOS 22.3 months. First‑line T+ subgroup (n=111) ORR 59.5%; mDOR 31.7 months.\n- Evidence gap addressed: long‑term durability and intracranial efficacy for tepotinib; supports 1L benefit.\n- Competitive implication: strengthens Tepotinib’s claim for durable systemic control and CNS activity vs ADCs (which often report higher ORR but shorter DoR) and newcomer TKIs — a core Medical Affairs message.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: emphasize the durable DOR in 1L and intracranial data when discussing sequencing and patient selection; cite 1996P in payer and testing dialogues.\n\n2) 1995P — VISION: Treatment sequencing & long‑term follow‑up\n- Key data: 1L cohort (n=164) ORR 57.9%, mDOR 31.7 months; 2L+ (n=149) ORR 45.0%, mDOR 12.6 months. Dose modifications: reductions 33.2%, interruptions 43.8%, discontinuations 15.7%. 65/145 progressed patients received subsequent MET inhibitors.\n- Evidence gap addressed: sequencing benefit of earlier use of tepotinib and real‑world dosing patterns.\n- Competitive implication: provides evidence to promote earlier use of Tepotinib and to set expectations on dose modifications.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: equip field with concrete figures on 1L vs later lines, and guidance on AE management to maintain exposure.\n\n3) 1998P — REAL‑MET: Real‑world tepotinib for patients with brain metastases (Japanese retrospective)\n- Key data: N=62 (15 with baseline brain mets). Systemic ORR 59% (brain mets) vs 69% (no brain mets); intracranial ORR evaluable subset (n=11) = 67%; mPFS roughly 8.3 mo (brain mets) vs 8.7 mo (no brain mets); mOS numerically worse for brain mets (16.6 vs 31.3 mo; p=0.07).\n- Evidence gap addressed: confirms real‑world intracranial activity but highlights poorer long‑term outcomes for patients with brain metastases.\n- Competitive implication: supports Tepotinib’s CNS activity claim; underscores need for integrated local/systemic approaches or earlier detection of brain disease.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: discuss intracranial response expectations and the importance of early testing and CNS surveillance.\n\n4) 1954P — SACHI (exploratory ctDNA analysis): Savolitinib + Osimertinib vs Chemotherapy in MET‑amplified EGFRm NSCLC\n- Key data: exploratory plasma NGS (Burning Rock) in 202 evaluable pts. EGFRm ctDNA clearance at C2/C3: 74% in savolitinib+osimertinib (46/62) vs 46% with chemotherapy (26/56). In patients with ctDNA clearance, mPFS was 11.6 months (combo) vs 6.9 months (chemo). Acquired MET mutations (10%) observed only in the combo arm.\n- Evidence gap addressed: demonstrates ctDNA dynamics as early pharmacodynamic marker and reveals therapy‑specific resistance patterns.\n- Competitive implication: positions savolitinib+osimertinib as a biomarker‑driven option in METamp EGFR‑mutant resistance; heightens importance of ctDNA monitoring.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: start discussions with KOLs about ctDNA integration in MET testing and explore observational data capturing ctDNA response in tepotinib cohorts.\n\n5) 1955P — SAVANNAH: Safety / tolerability of osimertinib + savolitinib (phase II safety dataset)\n- Key data (safety cohort n≈101 reported): hepatic AEs 35% (all grades) with 16% grade ≥3; peripheral edema 58% (11% grade ≥3); venous thromboembolism (VTE) 24% (7% grade 3). Dose interruptions/reductions common (osim interruptions 41%; savolitinib interruptions 48% and reductions 21%).\n- Evidence gap addressed: practical toxicity profile and mitigation needs for EGFR+MET combos.\n- Competitive implication: while combos are effective, toxicity burden and monitoring requirements could limit adoption — an area to highlight in safety comparisons.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: prepare AE management and monitoring guidance (LFTs, VTE vigilance) for clinicians comparing combo options.\n\n6) 1948P / 1951P / 1950P — Telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso‑V, LUMINOSITY) — efficacy, CDx transfer, ocular AEs\n- Key data: LUMINOSITY Stage I/II (n≈172): overall ORR 28.6% (95% CI 21.7–36.2); c‑MET high subgroup ORR 34.6% (95% CI 24.2–46.2); median DoR 8.3 months (c‑MET high DoR 9.0 months); ocular surface AEs in ~25% (mostly grade ≤2; median onset ~47 days). VENTANA MET SP44 CDx retesting showed concordant ORR (≈28–31% by CDx status). Dose modifications often preserved efficacy.\n- Evidence gap addressed: operationalizes IHC CDx for ADC selection and provides practical toxicity management guidance.\n- Competitive implication: Teliso‑V is a clear alternative for IHC‑selected MET‑overexpressing patients; CDx availability reduces testing friction and may accelerate adoption in centers that use IHC workflows.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: prepare balanced discussions on biomarker selection (METex14 vs MET IHC high) and tradeoffs between ORR and DoR/toxicity.\n\n7) 1960P — Amivantamab (SC formulation) + chemotherapy (cohort 3b)\n- Key data: investigator‑assessed ORR ~47% (ICR‑confirmed ~53%); mPFS ~7.9 months; low rates of infusion reactions with SC route (ARRs ~8% any grade, none grade 3); discontinuation for TRAEs 5%.\n- Evidence gap addressed: feasibility and operational advantages (SC) and intracranial activity data being pooled across programs.\n- Competitive implication: improved outpatient feasibility of amivantamab (SC) and prophylaxis approaches may increase adoption in EGFR+MET settings.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: discuss practical administration advantages and thrombosis/dermatologic AE mitigation when comparing to TKI approaches.\n\n8) 928P — DO‑2: First‑in‑human deuterated MET‑TKI (dose‑escalation)\n- Key data: n=26 across dose levels; confirmed PR in a treatment‑naïve METex14 patient; 8‑week DCR 76% overall; 100% DCR in 6 treatment‑naïve METex14 pts; grade 3 TRAEs 18%; notably no peripheral edema reported in early cohorts.\n- Evidence gap addressed: potential for differentiated tolerability (less edema) and activity from next‑generation chemistries.\n- Competitive implication: early tolerability advantages may attract clinicians if confirmed; monitor for expansion cohort outcomes.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: track safety differentiators and emphasize that cross‑trial comparisons are premature; focus on established VISION durability while monitoring DO‑2 progression.\n\n9) 1946P — MYTX‑011: pH‑dependent c‑MET ADC (KisMET‑01)\n- Key data (early phase I): activity reported across c‑MET low/intermediate/high tumors; ocular AEs and corneal epitheliopathy observed (class ADC signal).\n- Evidence gap addressed: ADC designs that claim broader activity across varying MET expression could expand the ADC‑eligible population.\n- Competitive implication: if validated, threatens the biomarker segmentation that favors MET TKIs (METex14 vs IHC).\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: reinforce the unique biology of METex14 and the need for splice‑aware testing before TKI decisions; discuss where ADCs appropriately fit.\n\n10) KUNPENG (vebreltinib / bozitinib) — Phase II in METex14 (reported in program highlights)\n- Key data: ORR overall 75.0% (95% CI 61.1–86.0), treatment‑naïve ORR 77.1%; median DoR 15.9 months; mPFS 14.1 months; mOS 20.7 months.\n- Evidence gap addressed: regional TKI with high ORR/duration signals — competitive in China.\n- Competitive implication: strong regional competition for Tepotinib in METex14 markets; monitor for global development/registrational plans.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: in-market messaging should emphasize confirmatory data and generalizability; watch for regulatory filings outside China.\n\n---\n\n### Competitive Intelligence — practical takeaways\n- The most immediate threats to Tepotinib uptake in practice are:\n  - ADCs with validated IHC CDx (telisotuzumab vedotin) that reduce adoption friction in pathology‑driven workflows.\n  - EGFR+MET combination regimens (savolitinib + osimertinib; amivantamab combinations) that capture MET‑amplified EGFR‑mutant patients after osimertinib.\n  - New TKIs or regionally strong TKIs (vebreltinib, DO‑2) that report high ORR or differentiated tolerability.\n- Opportunities for Tepotinib to defend/grow share:\n  - Emphasize VISION’s long‑term durability and intracranial data (1996P/1995P) versus ADCs whose DoR and toxicity profiles differ.\n  - Push diagnostic algorithms (NGS/plasma for METex14) so the right patients are routed to Tepotinib.\n  - Leverage ctDNA (VISION plasma analyses; SACHI data) to argue for monitoring strategies that favor targeted use and early detection.\n\n### Evidence Gaps: what ESMO will address vs what will remain\n- Addressed at ESMO:\n  - Long‑term tepotinib durability and intracranial data (1996P/1995P).\n  - ctDNA dynamics showing early molecular clearance with MET+EGFR combos (1954P).\n  - Operational feasibility and toxicity management for ADCs and bispecifics (1948P/1950P/1960P).\n  - Early signals from novel MET TKIs (928P).\n- Likely to remain unresolved after ESMO:\n  - Prospective data defining optimal sequencing after ADCs/bispecifics (no randomized sequencing data presented).\n  - Standardized, cross‑platform diagnostic cutoffs harmonizing NGS/FISH/IHC for METamp vs METex14.\n  - Prospective interventional trials that use ctDNA clearance to trigger therapy changes with validated outcome benefit.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Considerations for Medical Affairs\n\nNote: these suggestions are framed as options Medical Affairs/field teams may want to consider during and after ESMO. They are tactical and evidence‑focused rather than operational mandates.\n\n### Ten Strategic Questions for KOL Engagement\n(Each question = short KOL prompt → why it matters → which ESMO abstracts inform it → Tepotinib relevance)\n\n1. How do you prioritize ORR vs durability (DoR) and intracranial control when choosing therapy for METex14 patients?\n   - Why it matters: ADCs can deliver higher initial ORR but shorter DoR; tepotinib shows long DoR (VISION 1996P).\n   - Informs: 1996P (VISION), 1948P (Teliso‑V LUMINOSITY).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: use VISION 3‑year DOR/CNS data when discussing long‑term disease control.\n\n2. What testing algorithm do you use to identify METex14 vs MET amplification vs MET protein overexpression in routine practice?\n   - Why it matters: test method determines therapy (TKI for METex14; ADC for IHC‑high).\n   - Informs: 1996P (VISION tissue vs liquid findings), 1951P (Teliso‑V CDx concordance), 1923P (METRIX assay reproducibility).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: promote RNA‑aware NGS + plasma CDx pathway to maximize METex14 capture.\n\n3. In EGFR‑mutated patients progressing on osimertinib with MET changes, how do you choose between osimertinib + savolitinib, amivantamab combinations, chemotherapy, or other options?\n   - Why it matters: multiple options exist with differing toxicity and durability.\n   - Informs: 1954P (SACHI ctDNA), 1955P (SAVANNAH safety), 1960P (amivantamab SC).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: clarify that Tepotinib’s label is METex14; discuss data needs for using a MET‑selective TKI in METamp scenarios.\n\n4. How do you integrate ctDNA in on‑treatment monitoring and early response assessment for MET‑driven disease?\n   - Why it matters: ctDNA clearance correlates with PFS in SACHI (1954P).\n   - Informs: 1954P (SACHI), VISION plasma analyses (1996P).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: explore observational ctDNA monitoring to show early pharmacodynamic effect and guide sequencing.\n\n5. What are your strategies for patients with baseline brain metastases and METex14 disease — systemic therapy alone, local therapy first, or combined approaches?\n   - Why it matters: REAL‑MET (1998P) and VISION (1996P) show intracranial responses but differing OS.\n   - Informs: 1998P (REAL‑MET), 1996P (VISION).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: position Tepotinib as a systemically active option with CNS activity; discuss integration with SRS/surgery.\n\n6. For patients receiving ADCs (telisotuzumab vedotin), what are your main concerns on cumulative neuropathy and ocular AEs and how do you modify dosing?\n   - Why it matters: ADC toxicity management is operational and affects patient selection.\n   - Informs: 1948P/1950P (LUMINOSITY ocular/neuropathy analyses).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: highlight TKI vs ADC toxicity tradeoffs for shared decision‑making.\n\n7. After ADC or bispecific progression, what data would influence you to use a MET TKI (eg, tepotinib)? Have you seen meaningful responses?\n   - Why it matters: sequencing knowledge is limited; RWE needed.\n   - Informs: LUMINOSITY follow‑on notes; absence of prospective sequencing data.\n   - Tepotinib relevance: discuss the rationale and seek real‑world cases where tepotinib demonstrated benefit post‑ADC.\n\n8. How comfortable are you using plasma CDx alone to initiate targeted therapy in METex14 cases?\n   - Why it matters: plasma CDx enables access but sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs influence decisions.\n   - Informs: 1996P (VISION tissue+/liquid+ subgroup differences).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: emphasize concordant tissue/liquid VISION data and the practical advantages for frail patients.\n\n9. What resistance mechanisms (on ctDNA) do you commonly see after MET‑targeted combinations, and how does that change your next therapy?\n   - Why it matters: SACHI shows therapy‑specific acquired resistance (MET mutations after combo).\n   - Informs: 1954P (SACHI).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: use this to discuss the need for serial ctDNA to guide sequencing and to inform sponsor translational strategy.\n\n10. Which real‑world evidence endpoints (time to next therapy, treatment patterns, real‑world PFS/OS) would be most persuasive for payers about Tepotinib’s value?\n    - Why it matters: payers prioritize durability, subsequent therapy avoidance and CNS control.\n    - Informs: VISION (1996P/1995P) durability data and REAL‑MET real‑world intracranial outcomes (1998P).\n    - Tepotinib relevance: propose targeted RWE endpoints to demonstrate value.\n\n---\n\n### Ten High‑Value Discussion Topics (with angles and evidence)\n\n1. Diagnostic algorithm for MET alterations\n   - Angles: RNA‑aware tissue NGS for METex14; plasma CDx for access; reflex IHC/FISH for METamp confirmation.\n   - Evidence: VISION (1996P) tissue vs liquid, Teliso‑V CDx (1951P), METRIX assay work.\n   - How Tepotinib fits: stress plasma CDx complementarity for METex14 capture.\n\n2. Sequencing strategy: TKI → ADC → bispecific or ADC → TKI?\n   - Angles: ORR vs DoR tradeoffs, toxicity profiles, and patient goals (symptom control vs durable disease control).\n   - Evidence: VISION (1996P), LUMINOSITY (1948P), amivantamab cohort (1960P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: position Tepotinib for durable disease control especially when CNS control is needed.\n\n3. ctDNA as an early pharmacodynamic marker\n   - Angles: on‑treatment clearance predicts PFS; sampling cadence and analytical platforms.\n   - Evidence: SACHI (1954P), VISION plasma analyses (1996P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: justify observational ctDNA monitoring in clinical practice/RWE.\n\n4. Managing ADC toxicities and dose modifications\n   - Angles: neuropathy prevention/monitoring, ocular prophylaxis and early ophthalmology referral, dose‑holding rules.\n   - Evidence: LUMINOSITY toxicity and dose modification analyses (1948P,1950P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: compare TKI tolerability and dose‑modification strategies.\n\n5. Practical AE management for EGFR+MET combos\n   - Angles: liver monitoring, edema management, VTE risk mitigation (when to consider prophylaxis).\n   - Evidence: SAVANNAH safety (1955P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: discuss single‑agent TKI vs combo safety tradeoffs.\n\n6. CNS disease management in METex14\n   - Angles: intracranial response rates, timing of SRS vs systemic therapy, endpoints for trials.\n   - Evidence: VISION intracranial analyses (1996P), REAL‑MET (1998P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: highlight intracranial activity and potential to delay local therapy in selected pts.\n\n7. Use of plasma CDx in limited‑resource settings\n   - Angles: access to NGS vs IHC, turnaround time, reimbursement pathways.\n   - Evidence: VISION tissue/liquid findings (1996P), Teliso‑V CDx (1951P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: argue plasma CDx as a practical capture tool for METex14.\n\n8. Interpreting emerging MET TKI data (DO‑2, vebreltinib)\n   - Angles: cross‑trial comparability limits; need for confirmatory/active‑comparator data.\n   - Evidence: DO‑2 early results (928P), KUNPENG vebreltinib signals.\n   - How Tepotinib fits: maintain emphasis on mature follow‑up and confirmed CNS activity.\n\n9. Real‑world sequencing and barriers to subsequent therapy\n   - Angles: why patients with brain mets receive fewer subsequent lines (REAL‑MET), logistics/costs that limit sequencing.\n   - Evidence: REAL‑MET (1998P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: discuss early testing and referral to preserve sequencing options.\n\n10. Health‑economic considerations for MET agent choice\n    - Angles: upfront ORR vs duration (cost per month of disease control), outpatient administration (SC amivantamab), monitoring costs (ctDNA).\n    - Evidence: AMI SC data (1960P), Teliso‑V DoR (1948P), SACHI ctDNA (1954P).\n    - How Tepotinib fits: position based on durable disease control, reduced monitoring needs vs complex combo regimens.\n\n---\n\n### Ten Objection Handling Frameworks (scenario → structured response)\n\nFormat: Acknowledge → Context → Evidence → Differentiate → Position\n\n1. Objection: “Teliso‑V has higher ORR — why not give ADC first?”\n   - Acknowledge: “Good point — initial tumor shrinkage matters for symptomatic control.”\n   - Context: ADCs target c‑MET IHC high; ORR is important for rapid shrinkage.\n   - Evidence: Teliso‑V LUMINOSITY (1948P) ORR 28.6% overall, 34.6% in c‑MET high; median DoR 8.3 months.\n   - Differentiate: VISION (1996P) shows tepotinib durable DOR (17.4 months T+; 31.7 months 1L) and intracranial activity; toxicity differences (ADC neuropathy/ocular vs TKI edema) affect long‑term tolerability.\n   - Position: For patients where durable systemic and CNS control is the priority, Tepotinib is the evidence‑based choice; for immediate tumor shrinkage in IHC‑selected refractory patients, ADCs are an option — selection should be biomarker driven.\n\n2. Objection: “New TKIs (vebreltinib/DO‑2) report very high ORR — is Tepotinib obsolete?”\n   - Acknowledge: “New agents with strong early ORR are noteworthy.”\n   - Context: Early‑phase signals can be promising but need mature follow‑up and broader populations.\n   - Evidence: DO‑2 (928P) early PRs and 8‑week DCR; vebreltinib (KUNPENG) high ORR but regional data.\n   - Differentiate: Tepotinib has 3‑year VISION durability and intracranial data (1996P) across global cohorts.\n   - Position: Monitor newcomers closely; Tepotinib’s mature durability/CNS evidence remains a practical differentiator today.\n\n3. Objection: “Savolitinib+osimertinib clears ctDNA faster — shouldn’t we use that combo?”\n   - Acknowledge: “ctDNA clearance is compelling as an early biomarker.”\n   - Context: SACHI (1954P) shows higher ctDNA clearance and associated PFS benefit vs chemo in METamp EGFRm disease.\n   - Evidence: ctDNA clearance 74% (combo) vs 46% (chemo); cleared‑patient mPFS 11.6 vs 6.9 months.\n   - Differentiate: Savolitinib+osimertinib addresses METamp in EGFR‑mutant resistance; Tepotinib’s label is METex14 — these are different biomarker populations.\n   - Position: For METamp in EGFR‑mutant resistance consider combo approaches supported by ctDNA; for METex14, Tepotinib’s targeted monotherapy has robust single‑agent durability.\n\n4. Objection: “I’m worried about edema and hepatic toxicity with MET TKIs.”\n   - Acknowledge: “Safety is a key factor for patient quality of life.”\n   - Context: SAVANNAH (1955P) reports edema and hepatotoxicity in combinations; VISION long‑term safety is consistent with known class effects.\n   - Evidence: SAVANNAH: edema 58% (11% grade ≥3), hepatotoxicity 35% (16% grade ≥3). VISION: manageable long‑term safety with dose modifications (1995P).\n   - Differentiate: Tepotinib’s long‑term experience gives clear guidance on monitoring and dose‑modification strategies (33% dose reductions in VISION).\n   - Position: Offer practical monitoring algorithms (LFT schedule, edema management) and highlight that dose modifications preserved benefit in VISION.\n\n5. Objection: “How reliable is plasma CDx for starting therapy?”\n   - Acknowledge: “Test accuracy is critical when starting targeted therapy.”\n   - Context: VISION included tissue and liquid subgroups; plasma helps capture inaccessible tumors.\n   - Evidence: VISION (1996P) reported outcomes by tissue vs liquid detection; plasma detection associated with higher tumor burden and prognostic differences.\n   - Differentiate: Plasma CDx expands access but requires confirmatory clinical context; for symptomatic, rapidly progressing patients plasma results can be used pragmatically.\n   - Position: Use plasma CDx per label/algorithm — emphasize validation and concordance from VISION subgroup data.\n\n6. Objection: “Teliso‑V ocular events worry me — are ADC toxicities manageable in elderly pts?”\n   - Acknowledge: “Ocular and neuropathic AEs affect older patients particularly.”\n   - Context/Evidence: LUMINOSITY ocular AEs ~25% (mostly grade ≤2), neuropathy common (1948P/1950P); dose modifications preserved efficacy.\n   - Differentiate: Tepotinib toxicity profile is different — edema and manageable lab abnormalities vs ADC cumulative neuropathy/ocular.\n   - Position: For frail/elderly patients where neuropathy risk is high, Tepotinib is a reasonable first choice; for IHC‑select high tumor burden where quick shrinkage matters, ADCs may still be considered with careful monitoring.\n\n7. Objection: “Will tepotinib work after telisotuzumab or amivantamab?”\n   - Acknowledge: “Sequencing is an area with limited prospective data.”\n   - Context: ESMO LUMINOSITY analyses describe subsequent therapies but prospective post‑ADC sequencing data are limited.\n   - Evidence: LUMINOSITY exploratory results show patients received subsequent MET inhibitors, but outcomes are descriptive (1948P).\n   - Differentiate: Mechanistic rationale exists for TKI activity after ADC/bispecific progression if METex14 is retained; prospective RWE is needed.\n   - Position: Consider tepotinib in METex14 patients post‑ADC where METex14 persists; collect RWE and encourage case reporting to build evidence.\n\n8. Objection: “I prefer chemo + IO in older patients rather than targeted agents.”\n   - Acknowledge: “Chemo + IO is a standard first‑line for many driver‑negative patients.”\n   - Context: For driver‑positive METex14, targeted agents produce higher response and durability compared with chemo ± IO.\n   - Evidence: VISION 1L subgroup (1996P) shows ORR 59.5% and long mDOR 31.7 months in 1L.\n   - Differentiate: In METex14, targeted therapy often delivers better disease control and toxicity profile tailored to driver biology.\n   - Position: Recommend testing to identify METex14 upfront so patients can be offered targeted therapy rather than empiric chemo/IO.\n\n9. Objection: “Emerging TKIs claim less edema — is that clinically meaningful?”\n   - Acknowledge: “Lower incidence of a bothersome AE is attractive.”\n   - Context/Evidence: DO‑2 (928P) reports no peripheral edema in early cohorts; sample sizes are small.\n   - Differentiate: Tepotinib has large, mature data; early tolerability signals need confirmation in larger cohorts and across real‑world patients.\n   - Position: Watch DO‑2 expansion data; continue to use tepotinib’s known management pathways until larger confirmatory datasets exist.\n\n10. Objection: “Payers ask me for head‑to‑head data vs other MET agents — we don’t have it.”\n    - Acknowledge: “Head‑to‑head randomized data are scarce in METex14.”\n    - Context: Cross‑trial comparisons are common but unreliable.\n    - Differentiate: Tepotinib’s strength is matured, long‑term follow‑up (VISION); payers value durability, intracranial control and real‑world effectiveness.\n    - Position: Provide RWE, indirect treatment comparisons where methodologically sound, and emphasize durability/CNS endpoints in value dossiers.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence‑Generation Priorities (practical, staged suggestions)\n\nImmediate priorities (high strategic value, low resource requirement — actions to start During/Immediately After ESMO)\n- Rapid field materials: produce updated MSL slide deck and single‑page synthesis comparing VISION (1996P/1995P) vs LUMINOSITY (1948P), SACHI (1954P) and SAVANNAH (1955P) keyed to clinician questions.\n- Post‑hoc VISION subgroup analyses: prioritize internal analyses emphasizing intracranial responses, 1L vs later line outcomes and plasma vs tissue subgroups for dissemination at ESMO.\n- Comparator safety Q&A: practical scripts for MSLs on edema/liver monitoring (SAVANNAH), neuropathy/ocular risk (LUMINOSITY), and thrombosis (amivantamab).\n- Diagnostics guidance: create an actionable “MET testing algorithm” one‑pager (NGS/RNA → plasma CDx → IHC reflex for ADC candidacy) referencing VISION and Teliso‑V CDx data.\n- KOL roundtables: short advisory discussions (virtual/at‑ESMO) focused on sequencing (post‑ADC/TKI) and ctDNA monitoring — not a directive, but an early listening step.\n\nMedium‑term opportunities (moderate investment, 6–18 month horizon)\n- Prospective observational RWE registry: track METex14 patients treated with Tepotinib, capture ctDNA dynamics, CNS outcomes, and post‑ADC/bispecific sequencing outcomes (goal: multi‑center investigator‑initiated program).\n- Biomarker harmonization study (investigator collaborative): compare tissue RNA NGS, plasma ctDNA and IHC/FISH across sites to define operational cutoffs and workflows (builds on VISION and METRIX efforts).\n- Small investigator‑initiated sequencing cohorts: capture tepotinib activity after telisotuzumab vedotin or amivantamab progression (single‑arm, real‑world pragmatic cohorts).\n- Safety and tolerability resource development: ophthalmology and neurology referral pathways for centers using ADCs and procedural guidance for edema/VTE monitoring in MET combinations.\n\nLonger‑term considerations (major investment; consider only if strategic imperative)\n- Large comparative effectiveness RWE program (multi‑country) to evaluate time to next therapy, CNS outcomes and OS across MET TKIs and ADCs — may inform label/HTA dossiers.\n- Strategic translational program to prospectively collect serial ctDNA and tissue at progression to characterize acquired resistance architectures across ADCs, bispecifics and TKIs and identify salvage strategies (may inform future combination development).\n\n---\n\n## At ESMO: Priority Engagement (who/what to prioritize)\n\nSuggested KOLs to meet (high strategic value; pick a small set to focus time):\n- Frank Griesinger — University of Oldenburg (VISION lead; 1996P/1995P).

During ESMO, Medical Affairs may want to prioritize rapid field enablement (comparator Q&A, diagnostic algorithm one‑pager, and a ctDNA monitoring primer), while leadership may want to monitor competitor regulatory moves and consider targeted RWE investments to protect and grow Tepotinib’s position."

    "analysis": "# Strategic Briefing: Bladder Cancer — ESMO 2025 (Pre‑conference; based on ESMO 2025 abstracts)\n\n*This is a pre‑conference strategic briefing prepared for Medical Affairs, MSLs and leadership. All statements below are based on ESMO 2025 abstracts and the provided intel set (reports and raw abstracts). Use as a working playbook for conference interactions and immediate post‑conference priorities.*\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nAvelumab (Bavencio) enters ESMO 2025 as the established 1L maintenance option after platinum‑based chemotherapy for locally advanced / metastatic urothelial carcinoma (la/mUC). The JAVELIN Bladder 100 program and real‑world datasets continue to support durable survival and manageable long‑term safety in the chemo→maintenance treatment pathway. However, a strong ADC + ICI wave — led by enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab (EV+P) — is moving upstream into first‑line and perioperative spaces and is the largest immediate commercial threat to avelumab’s maintenance‑eligible population.\n\nBased on ESMO 2025 abstracts, the most consequential items to watch are: (1) EV‑franchise data confirming durable PFS/OS benefit across subgroups (EV‑302; updated 2.5‑year follow‑up and subgroup analyses 3073P/3074P); (2) maintenance‑combination signals that outperform avelumab monotherapy on PFS (JAVELIN Bladder Medley Ave + SG interim 3083P / Ave+SG broader interim results); and (3) rapid maturation of fluid MRD (plasma ctDNA + urine utDNA) as a predictive tool in perioperative/adjuvant settings (CheckMate‑274 ctDNA subset 3068O; CURATE‑UTUC 3075P). Secondary but important signals include next‑gen Nectin‑4 ADCs (CRB‑701), TROP2/HER2 ADC combinations and selective FGFR3 inhibitors (LY3866288).\n\nTop strategic priorities for Medical Affairs at and immediately after ESMO: protect and articulate avelumab’s evidence base for maintenance (real‑world and sequencing messages), rapidly operationalize MRD and biomarker conversations with KOLs (ctDNA/utDNA, NECTIN‑4, HER2, FGFR3), and prepare balanced, evidence‑based messaging on ADC+ICI efficacy versus safety trade‑offs for field teams and payers.\n\n---\n\n## Pre‑ESMO 2025 Bladder Cancer Landscape\n\n### Current Treatment Paradigm\n- Standard pathways (as of pre‑ESMO 2025) broadly split into:\n  - Chemo‑first (cisplatin‑eligible): platinum‑based chemotherapy → if disease controlled → 1L maintenance avelumab (Bavencio). JAVELIN Bladder 100 is the pivotal randomized evidence base showing survival benefit for maintenance avelumab in patients with non‑progressive disease after platinum chemotherapy (trial population N≈700 in pivotal program; subgroups confirm benefit in low‑burden patients).\n  - ADC + ICI first‑line: EV + pembrolizumab (EV+P) has moved into 1L in many centers after positive registrational data and long‑term updates (EV‑302; n=886 randomized). This pathway is being adopted particularly in settings where high upfront ORR and rapid disease control are prioritized.\n  - Biomarker‑defined therapies: FGFR inhibitors (erdafitinib) for FGFR2/3 alterations, HER2 ADCs in HER2‑expressing tumors, and ADCs targeting TROP2/NECTIN‑4 are now important options in later lines and are moving earlier for selected patients.\n- Diagnostic landscape relevant to avelumab:\n  - PD‑L1 testing has limited but situational use (e.g., neoadjuvant selection), while new biomarker use (NECTIN‑4 amplification, HER2 IHC, FGFR3 genomic tests) is accelerating due to ADC/targeted agent programs.\n  - ctDNA/utDNA MRD assays are rapidly maturing and are presented as actionable risk stratifiers in adjuvant/perioperative trials — which will influence downstream systemic therapy volumes and sequencing.\n\n### Competitive Positioning (how avelumab compares)\n- Strengths:\n  - Randomized, mature survival evidence for 1L maintenance after platinum chemotherapy (JAVELIN program) with confirmatory real‑world datasets (AVENANCE).\n  - Established tolerability profile and feasibility in broad practice (including long‑term exposure data).\n- Competitive pressures:\n  - EV+P (enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab) shows large PFS and OS advantages versus chemotherapy in 1L (EV‑302 2.5‑yr update: median PFS 12.5 vs 6.3 mo, HR 0.48; median OS 33.8 vs 15.9 mo, HR 0.51; n=886). EV+P’s move into 1L and perioperative territories reduces the pool of patients who would follow chemo→avelumab maintenance.\n  - ADC‑centric strategies are proliferating (TROP2 ADCs, HER2 ADCs, next‑gen Nectin‑4 ADCs) — this fragments options and pushes need for new biomarkers and sequencing data.\n- Market dynamics:\n  - In centers where EV+P is rapidly adopted as first‑line, the chemo→avelumab population shrinks; where chemo‑first pathways persist, avelumab remains the standard.\n  - Avelumab’s continuing value proposition is strongest in patients who receive platinum and achieve disease control, in settings where EV adoption is slower, and in regions with constrained ADC access or where toxicity management is a concern.\n\n### Evidence Gaps and Unmet Needs\n- Sequencing after ADC+ICI (EV+P) progression: prospective data are limited on optimal next lines (post‑EV options, second ADC sequencing, targeted small molecules).\n- NECTIN‑4 assay standardization and prospective biomarker‑directed randomization: multiple retrospective/validation cohorts show NECTIN‑4 amplification predicts EV response (3090P/3087P) but prospective validation and assay harmonization (FISH vs IHC H‑score thresholds) are missing.\n- MRD operationalization: ctDNA/utDNA prospectively predict relapse (CheckMate‑274 ctDNA subset, CURATE‑UTUC) but randomized MRD‑guided intervention trials are still few.\n- Frail and ECOG ≥2 patients: data on ADC+ICI tolerability and maintenance usefulness in frail/older patients remain limited despite subgroup/real‑world analyses.\n- Comparative PRO and long‑term OS for maintenance ADC+ICI combos (e.g., Ave+SG interim shows PFS benefit but OS immature and toxicity high): final OS and HRQoL data are needed to assess net clinical benefit.\n\n---\n\n## What's Being Presented at ESMO 2025 in Bladder Cancer\n\nBelow are the high‑priority studies (abstract IDs) that materially affect avelumab positioning — each entry includes the actual numbers reported in the abstracts (where available), the evidence gap addressed, competitive implications, and practical Medical Affairs uses.\n\n### High‑Priority Studies Relevant to Our Portfolio\n\n1. 3068O — CheckMate‑274: Adjuvant nivolumab vs placebo — 5‑year efficacy + ctDNA (NCT02632409)\n   - Key data (abstract): randomized Phase 3, N=709 high‑risk MIBC post‑surgery. ITT DFS median 21.9 vs 11.0 months (HR 0.74). PD‑L1 ≥1%: DFS median 55.5 vs 8.4 months (HR 0.58). In ctDNA‑positive patients (exploratory; N=54 evaluable), DFS 7.4 vs 2.8 months (HR 0.35); ctDNA‑negative patients showed no benefit.\n   - Evidence gap addressed: ctDNA as a predictive MRD biomarker for adjuvant IO.\n   - Competitive implication: strengthens adjuvant IO positioning using MRD to select high‑risk patients — may alter perioperative pathways and affect the pool of patients requiring later systemic therapy (indirect impact to maintenance volumes).\n   - Use for MA: discuss MRD testing operationalization with surgical and medical oncology KOLs; align on how perioperative MRD signals may affect downstream maintenance decisions.\n\n2. EV‑302 updated analyses (multiple abstracts; EV program)\n   - Key data (EV‑302 2.5‑yr update — PMIDs reported): Phase 3 randomized, n=886 (EV+P 442 vs chemo 444). Median PFS 12.5 vs 6.3 months (HR 0.48). Median OS 33.8 vs 15.9 months (HR 0.51). Subgroups (3073P): age ≥75 PFS 12.3 vs 6.0 (HR 0.43), OS 24.4 vs 11.6 (HR 0.51); diabetes and reduced GFR subgroups also favored EV+P with substantial HRs.\n   - Evidence gap addressed: generalizability to elderly and comorbid populations, long‑term durability.\n   - Competitive implication: EV+P is a high‑impact first‑line standard in many centers; this reduces chemo→avelumab candidate numbers and may change institutional pathways.\n   - Use for MA: field tools to discuss sequencing rationale, toxicity management, and real‑world applicability; collect RWE on local adoption patterns to inform payer conversations.\n\n3. 3074P — EV‑103 Cohort K (cisplatin‑ineligible 1L): EV + pembrolizumab vs EV alone — long‑term follow‑up\n   - Key data: randomized cohort in cisplatin‑ineligible la/mUC; n≈149 total (EV+P n=76, EV n=73), median follow‑up 44.8 months. Central ORR 65.8% (EV+P) vs 45.2% (EV); median DOR 38.7 vs 13.2 months; median PFS 29.0 vs 8.2 months; 36‑month OS rate 44.1% vs 31.5%.\n   - Evidence gap addressed: efficacy and durability of EV+P in cisplatin‑ineligible patients.\n   - Competitive implication: EV+P yields deep, durable responses in patients who are often not candidates for platinum; this is a direct competing pathway to avelumab maintenance for cisplatin‑ineligible patients who might otherwise receive chemo alternatives.\n   - Use for MA: equip MSLs with data to discuss cisplatin‑ineligible decision algorithms and to capture how institutions prioritize ADC+ICI vs chemo→maintenance.\n\n4. 3083P — JAVELIN Bladder Medley: Avelumab + sacituzumab govitecan (Ave+SG) vs avelumab monotherapy — subgroup PFS analyses\n   - Key data: randomized 2:1 Ave+SG (n=74) vs Ave mono (n=37). Interim median PFS overall reported earlier 11.17 vs 3.75 months (HR 0.49). Subgroup highlights in 3083P: visceral mets at start of 1L PBC — PFS 9.30 vs 2.20 months (HR 0.43); liver lesions at randomization — 7.62 vs 1.94 months (HR 0.38); lung lesions — 5.62 vs 1.94 months (HR 0.52). Grade ≥3 TRAEs were substantially higher with Ave+SG (reported range across subgroups 52.9%–75.0%) vs very low in Ave mono arm in the abstract table.\n   - Evidence gap addressed: whether ADC + ICI maintenance improves outcomes over PD‑L1 monotherapy maintenance.\n   - Competitive implication: Ave+SG PFS signal is promising — if OS matures favorably and toxicity is manageable, maintenance ADC+ICI could shift standard of care and expand the role of avelumab when combined with ADCs. Toxicity trade‑offs are central.\n   - Use for MA: prepare balanced messaging: emphasize PFS gain but explain immature OS and substantial toxicity; collect clinician perspectives on tolerability thresholds and patient selection.\n\n5. 3109eP — AVENANCE: Real‑world avelumab 1L maintenance outcomes (France)\n   - Key data: ambispective non‑interventional study, effectiveness population N=595, median follow‑up 33.2 months. Conditional survival favourable in patients completing 1 or 2 years (example: additional OS at 1 yr ~88% for those who reach 1 year). Any‑grade TRAEs reported after 1 year in 56.3% and after 2 years in 30.5%; no new long‑term safety signals.\n   - Evidence gap addressed: real‑world durability and long‑term tolerability of maintenance avelumab.\n   - Competitive implication: strong RWE supports avelumab’s maintenance positioning especially where access to ADCs/biomarkers is limited.\n   - Use for MA: use RWE to support payer discussions and localized adoption cases; present in KOL exchanges to demonstrate generalizability outside trials.\n\n6. 3069MO / 3084P — Perioperative landscape (NEMIO / NIAGARA updates)\n   - Key data (NEMIO): Phase I/II ddMVAC + durvalumab ± tremelimumab in cT2‑4 MIBC, N=121; pCR surgical pop 48%, ITT pCR 45%; 2‑yr EFS ≈76%, OS ≈86%; grade 3 TRAEs 42% overall (30% D arm; 54% D+T arm). NIAGARA HRQoL reports confirm EFS/OS benefits without HRQoL detriment.\n   - Evidence gap addressed: perioperative ICI added to neoadjuvant chemo efficacy and HRQoL.\n   - Competitive implication: perioperative ICI success increases use of IO in curative settings and reshapes adjuvant decisions — may indirectly influence how many patients later require maintenance therapy.\n   - Use for MA: align with urology/surgical KOLs on operational impact and on MRD integration into perioperative workflows.\n\n7. 3075P — CURATE‑UTUC: Plasma ctDNA + urine utDNA for MRD and adjuvant risk stratification (UTUC)\n   - Key data: prospective cohort N=78. Dual fluid MRD detected relapse with 94.1% sensitivity and median lead time ~106 days prior to clinical recurrence. Post‑op month‑1 ctDNA+ predicted extravesical/systemic relapse (HR 8.6); ctDNA+ after 2 cycles predicted systemic relapse dramatically (HR 40.9). utDNA+ associated with intravesical relapse (HR 17.3).\n   - Evidence gap addressed: MRD detection and early intervention signals in UTUC; urine adds site‑specific information.\n   - Competitive implication: supports MRD‑guided adjuvant strategies and bladder/renal‑sparing trials that use molecular selection — shifts treatment timing and patient populations.\n   - Use for MA: discuss practical assay timing and sampling (plasma+urine) with KOLs and pathology partners; consider integration into future internal RWE and trial designs.\n\n8. 3070MO — LY3866288 (FORAGER‑1): Isoform‑selective FGFR3 inhibitor (dose optimization)\n   - Key data: Phase I pooled A1+A2 n=176; 200 mg BID chosen for expansion. TEAEs mainly grade 1–2; at 200 mg BID ORR ≈38% (31/82) in treated population and activity in FGFRi‑pretreated patients.\n   - Evidence gap addressed: next‑generation FGFR3 inhibitor with better tolerability and potential synergy with EV.\n   - Competitive implication: more selective FGFR3 inhibition increases options for FGFR3‑altered patients and affects sequencing choices relative to ADCs and avelumab.\n   - Use for MA: track combination cohorts (LY + EV + pembrolizumab) and FGFR3 testing uptake.\n\n9. 3072MO — Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato‑DXd) + rilvegostomig (anti‑PD‑1/TIGIT) — TROPION‑PanTumor03\n   - Key data: Phase II a/mUC cohorts: 1L cisplatin‑ineligible ORR 68.2% (n=22), DCR 95.5% at 12 weeks; 2L ORR 33.3% (n=18), median PFS 12.5 months (2L). Grade 3 TRAEs 18.2% (1L) and 38.9% (2L); 1 adjudicated ILD in each cohort.\n   - Evidence gap addressed: activity of non‑NECTIN‑4 ADCs in UC (TROP2 target), offering a route for NECTIN‑4‑low tumors.\n   - Competitive implication: further fragments ADC landscape — more patients will be considered for ADC options, complicating maintenance sequencing.\n   - Use for MA: monitor activity in NECTIN‑4‑low patients and ILD risk management.\n\n10. 967P — CRB‑701 (SYS6002): Next‑generation Nectin‑4 ADC (first‑in‑human)\n    - Key data: Phase I/II escalation (n=54): responses observed in mUC; no DLTs in escalation; grade 3 AEs ~30%; lower reported rates of skin rash, neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy vs historical MMAE ADCs.\n    - Evidence gap addressed: ADC with potentially improved safety profile vs existing MMAE payloads.\n    - Competitive implication: if tolerability holds in expansion, CRB‑701 could be a meaningful challenger to EV in tolerability‑sensitive populations.\n    - Use for MA: track tolerability signals and dosing regimens; prepare comparative messaging on safety profiles.\n\n11. 3085P — PUNCH02: Tislelizumab + disitamab vedotin for bladder‑preserving strategy (MIBC) with utDNA selection\n    - Key data: Phase II single‑arm N=28 HER2 IHC 2+/3+ MIBC; utDNA‑defined cCR rate 71.4% (95% CI 51.1–86.1%); in HER2 3+ utDNA‑defined cCR 88.9%; bladder‑preservation rate among utDNA cCR = 100%; AEs predominantly grade 1–2.\n    - Evidence gap addressed: combining HER2 ADC + ICI for organ preservation guided by molecular MRD.\n    - Competitive implication: organ‑sparing strategies using ADC+ICI and MRD selection could redefine perioperative decisions and reduce metastatic caseloads.\n    - Use for MA: discuss patient selection frameworks and logistics of HER2 testing + serial utDNA with urology and radiation oncology KOLs.\n\n12. 3111eP / 3112eP — EV real‑world and older‑patient cohorts (EVOLUTE / France EAP)\n    - Key data (3111eP): EV 2L+ early access N=211; median OS 8.5 mo overall; ECOG 0–1 OS 11.7 mo vs ECOG 2 OS 4.8 mo; ORR 38.9%. (3112eP) Older patients ≥70 had higher grade ≥3 toxicity (44.2% vs 21.3%) and higher discontinuation for toxicity (34.6% vs 4.3%).\n    - Evidence gap addressed: real‑world tolerability and outcomes, especially in frail/elderly populations.\n    - Competitive implication: practical toxicity and discontinuation rates provide counterpoints to EV+P efficacy claims when discussing patient‑level decision making.\n    - Use for MA: collect real‑world tolerability narratives to support balanced sequencing conversations.\n\n---\n\n### LBA / Late‑Breaking items to watch (data pending or limited in abstract)\n- LBA2 — KEYNOTE‑905: Perioperative enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab in cisplatin‑ineligible MIBC. This is a proffered LBA; expect pCR, EFS, surgical feasibility and biomarker (NECTIN‑4 / ctDNA) analyses. If positive, this materially expands EV+P into curative perioperative settings.\n- LBA110 — GDFather‑NEO: Neoadjuvant nivolumab + visugromab (anti‑GDF‑15) in MIBC. LBA placement suggests potentially practice‑informing pCR signals in the neoadjuvant setting.\n- LBA109 — DISCUS: randomized phase II comparing 3 vs 6 cycles platinum prior to avelumab maintenance — may change pre‑maintenance chemo exposure requirements (results will inform field messaging about optimal chemo duration).\n\nFor LBAs: full data may be presented at sessions; use future tense in field interactions until full slides/publication available.\n\n---\n\n### Competitive Intelligence — short synthesis\n- Highest threat: enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab (EV+P). Robust phase 3 evidence (EV‑302, n=886) with durable PFS/OS and subgroup generalizability (elderly/comorbid/cisplatin‑ineligible) — high adoption traction.\n- Maintenance evolution: avelumab + ADC combinations (Ave+SG) show strong PFS signals but higher toxicity — if OS matures favorably, this becomes an evolution of our own maintenance franchise; balancing toxicity is crucial.\n- New ADC classes (TROP2, next‑gen Nectin‑4, HER2 ADCs) are proliferating and will expand the ADC‑eligible pool and biomarker testing requirements.\n- Biomarker drivers: NECTIN‑4 amplification repeatedly predicts EV sensitivity (3090P/3087P) — prospective assay standardization is a critical competitive inflection point.\n- MRD/ctDNA: moving fast toward clinical utility. Positive MRD trials will change adjuvant use of IO and the timing of systemic therapy.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence Gaps: What ESMO 2025 will address vs what remains\n- Partially addressed at ESMO:\n  - MRD utility: CheckMate‑274 ctDNA subset (3068O) and CURATE‑UTUC (3075P) advance actionable MRD evidence (predictive/prognostic signals).\n  - EV+P generalizability: EV‑302 follow‑up and subgroup analyses (3073P/3074P) demonstrate benefit in frail/elderly and cisplatin‑ineligible groups.\n  - Maintenance ADC + ICI concept proof (JAVELIN Medley 3083P) — PFS signals across subgroups.\n- Remaining gaps after ESMO:\n  - Prospective randomized NECTIN‑4 amplification–guided trials and assay concordance standards.\n  - Mature OS and QoL readouts for maintenance ADC+ICI combinations — OS data for Ave+SG currently immature.\n  - Prospective randomized MRD‑guided interventional trials with predefined management algorithms.\n  - Clear prospective guidance on sequencing post‑ADC progression (what to give after EV+P failure).\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Considerations for Medical Affairs\n\nThe sections below are directly usable for KOL interactions, MSL field conversations and internal strategy discussions. Language is suggestive and non‑prescriptive.\n\n### Ten Strategic Questions for KOL Engagement\n(Each question = context → relevant ESMO abstract(s) → how avelumab relates)\n\n1. How are you choosing between upfront EV+P and chemotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance in your 1L la/mUC patients?  \n   - Context: EV‑302 (2.5‑yr update) shows large PFS/OS gains (median OS 33.8 vs 15.9 mo, HR 0.51; n=886).  \n   - ESMO abstracts: EV‑302 subgroup data (3073P), EV‑103 cohort K (3074P).  \n   - Relation to avelumab: probes local thresholds for efficacy vs toxicity and identifies where chemo→avelumab remains preferred (e.g., limited ADC access, toxicity concerns, resected adjuvant contexts).\n\n2. Where do MRD signals (plasma ctDNA or urine utDNA) change your adjuvant vs neoadjuvant strategy?  \n   - Context: CheckMate‑274 ctDNA subset (3068O) and CURATE‑UTUC (3075P) show ctDNA/utDNA strongly prognostic/predictive.  \n   - Relation to avelumab: will MRD‑guided adjuvant strategies shift numbers entering the metastatic pathway where maintenance avelumab is relevant?\n\n3. What would you require to adopt NECTIN‑4 amplification testing in routine practice to guide EV use?  \n   - Context: NECTIN‑4 amplification validated in multiple cohorts (3087P/3090P) with large ORR and PFS differences.  \n   - Relation: If NECTIN‑4 assays become standard, EV uptake may accelerate for amplification‑positive patients, reducing chemo→avelumab candidates.\n\n4. For cisplatin‑ineligible patients, do you prefer EV+P upfront or alternatives that preserve later maintenance options?  \n   - Context: EV‑103 Cohort K (3074P) shows ORR 65.8% with EV+P and long DOR (median 38.7 months).  \n   - Relation: Understand which subpopulations remain eligible for chemo→avelumab sequences.\n\n5. In patients with visceral (liver/lung) metastases, how are PFS gains vs toxicity influencing maintenance vs ADC strategies?  \n   - Context: JAVELIN Medley Ave+SG subgroup PFS gains (3083P) and EV subgroup benefits (3073P).  \n   - Relation: Discuss trade‑offs for avelumab maintenance where high visceral burden predicts shorter chemo responses.\n\n6. How do you manage ADC‑associated neuropathy/skin toxicity risk and would predictive biomarkers change your prescribing?  \n   - Context: EV toxicities noted across EV programs; early biomarker signal for EV neurotoxicity (3108P).  \n   - Relation: Identifies where avelumab’s tolerability becomes a differentiator.\n\n7. For MRD‑positive (ctDNA+) post‑surgery MIBC patients, would you prefer adjuvant IO, enrollment in trials, or closer surveillance?  \n   - Context: CheckMate‑274 ctDNA subset (3068O) showed large DFS benefit in ctDNA+ patients (DFS HR 0.35).  \n   - Relation: Impacts perioperative care and later systemic therapy demand.\n\n8. How do you weigh PFS improvements (e.g., Ave+SG interim) against grade ≥3 toxicity when considering maintenance escalation?  \n   - Context: JAVELIN Medley 3083P shows improved PFS but high grade ≥3 TRAEs for Ave+SG.  \n   - Relation: Informs MSL messaging about patient selection and toxicity monitoring.\n\n9. What are your real‑world barriers to implementing serial ctDNA/utDNA testing (logistics, reimbursement, timing)?  \n   - Context: CURATE‑UTUC (3075P) demonstrates strong lead‑time but operational complexity remains.  \n   - Relation: Helps MA design support tools for assay adoption.\n\n10. What outcomes would persuade you to continue chemo→avelumab rather than switch to ADC+ICI first line?  \n    - Context: EV‑302 long‑term OS and EV‑103 durable PFS; counterbalance is JAVELIN Bladder 100 randomized maintenance survival data and AVENANCE RWE.  \n    - Relation: Clarifies thresholds for institution‑level pathway changes.\n\n### Ten High‑Value Discussion Topics (for advisory boards / MSLs)\n(Each: 2–3 discussion angles, ESMO evidence, how avelumab fits)\n\n1. MRD (plasma + urine) operationalization and clinical thresholds  \n   - Angles: sampling frequency; ctDNA positivity thresholds tied to treatment; urine for intravesical risk.  \n   - Evidence: CheckMate‑274 ctDNA subset (3068O); CURATE‑UTUC (3075P).  \n   - Role for avelumab: discuss whether MRD could identify patients who will not need early systemic therapy vs those who should be fast‑tracked.\n\n2. Sequencing algorithms in the ADC era (EV+P first vs chemo→avelumab)  \n   - Angles: disease burden and speed of control; frailty; biomarker positivity (NECTIN‑4, HER2).  \n   - Evidence: EV‑302 updates and subgroup data (3073P/3074P).  \n   - Role for avelumab: emphasize maintenance after chemo when ADC access or toxicity concerns prevail.\n\n3. NECTIN‑4 amplification: clinical readiness and assay standardization  \n   - Angles: assay selection (IHC H‑score vs genomic amplification), turn‑around times, impact on EV utilization.  \n   - Evidence: NECTIN‑4 validation cohorts (3087P/3090P).  \n   - Role for avelumab: prepare counterarguments on benefit in NECTIN‑4‑low populations and alternative sequences.\n\n4. Maintenance escalation — which patients benefit from ADC + ICI (Ave+SG) versus PD‑L1 monotherapy?  \n   - Angles: absolute PFS vs OS expectations; toxicity thresholds; patient preferences.  \n   - Evidence: JAVELIN Medley (3083P) interim PFS and safety.  \n   - Role for avelumab: position as proven survival benefit in chemo→maintenance; frame Ave+SG as promising but immature for OS.\n\n5. Frail/elderly patient management and tolerability trade‑offs  \n   - Angles: EV real‑world toxicity in older patients (3112eP); EV‑302 subgroup benefits vs toxicity management.  \n   - Evidence: EV real‑world cohorts (3111eP/3112eP) and 3073P EV subgroup analysis.  \n   - Role for avelumab: highlight safety and feasibility in long‑term use.\n\n6. Perioperative interplay: neoadjuvant IO/ADC and downstream systemic needs  \n   - Angles: how perioperative responses change adjuvant and metastatic burden; organ‑preservation approaches.  \n   - Evidence: NEMIO/NIAGARA (3069MO/3084P), PUNCH02 (3085P).  \n   - Role for avelumab: forecast changes in metastatic caseload and argue for flexible maintenance options if relapse occurs.\n\n7. Next‑gen ADCs and differentiating payload/target biology  \n   - Angles: payload toxicity profiles; target expression across subtypes; opportunities for sequencing.  \n   - Evidence: CRB‑701 (967P), Dato‑DXd (3072MO), disitamab vedotin programs (3071MO/3085P).  \n   - Role for avelumab: frame combination or sequencing opportunities vs standalone maintenance.\n\n8. PROs and QoL as decision drivers for maintenance vs ADC first‑line  \n   - Angles: patient tolerability vs survival gains; caregiver burden.  \n   - Evidence: EV‑302 PRO analyses (EV‑302 PROs PMID 40449498), AVENANCE RWE HRQOL signals.  \n   - Role for avelumab: use PRO data to support maintenance in patients prioritizing QoL.\n\n9. Test deployment: NECTIN‑4, HER2, FGFR3 and PD‑L1 — which tests to order up front?  \n   - Angles: reflex testing strategies; tissue vs blood; cost and turnaround.  \n   - Evidence: FGFR3 AI pathology detection (1766eP), LY3866288 FGFR3 activity (3070MO), NECTIN‑4 amplification studies.  \n   - Role for avelumab: encourage minimal essential Panels so maintenance eligibility is preserved regardless of first‑line choice.\n\n10. Post‑ADC progression options: what to study next  \n    - Angles: salvage chemo, antibody sequencing, targeted small molecules; trial opportunities.  \n    - Evidence: Disitamab/FGFR/ERBB2 subgroup analyses (various posters) and THOR Asian erdafitinib data.  \n    - Role for avelumab: collection of RWE to inform sponsor strategy for post‑ADC sequencing.\n\n### Ten Objection Handling Frameworks (scenario → framework)\nFormat: Acknowledge → Context → Evidence → Differentiation → Strategic positioning\n\n1. Objection: \"EV+P shows superior OS — maintenance avelumab is obsolete.\"  \n   - Acknowledge: EV‑302 shows robust OS/PFS advantages in 1L.  \n   - Context: EV+P adoption depends on access, toxicity management, and biomarker selection.  \n   - Evidence: EV‑302 median OS 33.8 vs 15.9 mo (HR 0.51); JAVELIN Bladder 100 has randomized maintenance survival evidence in the chemo‑first population.  \n   - Differentiate: Avelumab addresses the chemo→maintenance pathway with proven survival benefit where that pathway remains preferred/feasible.  \n   - Position: For centers choosing chemo‑first, avelumab remains the evidence‑based maintenance option; for centers adopting EV+P first‑line, focus shifts to sequencing research and RWE.\n\n2. Objection: \"Ave + SG shows pronounced PFS benefit — why not use this broadly?\"  \n   - Acknowledge: Ave+SG improves PFS in interim analyses.  \n   - Context: OS immature; grade ≥3 TRAEs substantially higher with Ave+SG in the abstract.  \n   - Evidence: JAVELIN Medley interim median PFS ~11.2 vs 3.8 mo (HR 0.49); subgroup PFS improvements reported.  \n   - Differentiate: Safety profile and durability (OS) are key decision points.  \n   - Position: Consider Ave+SG for selected fit patients with clear benefit‑risk acceptance; await mature OS/HRQoL data to expand use.\n\n3. Objection: \"NECTIN‑4 amplification makes EV irresistible for first‑line patients.\"  \n   - Acknowledge: NECTIN‑4 amplification is strongly associated with EV sensitivity in retrospective cohorts.  \n   - Context: Validation cohorts show large ORR and PFS differences but prospective assay standards are lacking.  \n   - Evidence: NECTIN‑4 amp cohorts: ORR 78% vs 36% and PFS HR ~0.33, OS HR ~0.28 in some cohorts (3090P/3087P).  \n   - Differentiate: Not all patients have NECTIN‑4 amp; when amp negative or unknown, other strategies (chemo→avelumab) remain relevant.  \n   - Position: Advocate for diagnostic standardization; in the interim, use shared decision‑making and consider trial enrollment for biomarker‑driven care.\n\n4. Objection: \"MRD means adjuvant IO will absorb patients who otherwise would get maintenance avelumab.\"  \n   - Acknowledge: MRD identifies a high‑risk subset who benefit from adjuvant IO (CheckMate‑274 ctDNA subset).  \n   - Context: MRD will refine who needs earlier systemic therapy vs observation but is not yet fully standardized.  \n   - Evidence: CheckMate‑274 ctDNA+ DFS HR 0.35 favoring nivolumab.  \n   - Differentiate: MRD adoption will be stepwise and may vary by region; maintenance role remains for metastatic disease after chemo control.  \n   - Position: Teams might explore MRD workflows and support MRD assay access while tracking how adjuvant practice changes local maintenance demand.\n\n5. Objection: \"Older/frail patients get worse toxicity with EV — avelumab is safer.\"  \n   - Acknowledge: Real‑world EV data show higher grade ≥3 toxicity and discontinuation in older patients (3112eP).  \n   - Context: EV+P delivers higher efficacy but also carries neuropathy/skin risks; management resources matter.  \n   - Evidence: EV real‑world N=211 median OS 8.5 mo overall; older patients ≥70 had grade ≥3 toxicity 44.2% vs 21.3%.  \n   - Differentiate: Avelumab maintenance has an established tolerability profile and may be preferable in frail patients.  \n   - Position: Discuss individual patient goals and toxicity tolerance; avelumab remains an option where tolerability is prioritized.\n\n6. Objection: \"We lack assay capacity for NECTIN‑4/FGFR3/HER2 — cannot biomarker‑direct therapy.\"  \n   - Acknowledge: Diagnostic logistics are a barrier in many centers.  \n   - Context: Rapid adoption of multiple biomarker tests is operationally challenging.  \n   - Evidence: AI/H&E and digital pathology approaches (1766eP, 3091P) offer promise to identify alterations with less tissue.  \n   - Differentiate: Avelumab’s maintenance indication does not require NECTIN‑4 testing; it is agnostic to these markers post‑chemo control.  \n   - Position: Teams may want to pilot reflex testing algorithms and use simpler PD‑L1/ctDNA workflows while diagnostic capacity scales.\n\n7. Objection: \"What do we give after progression on EV+P?\"  \n   - Acknowledge: Post‑EV sequencing is an area of unmet need.  \n   - Context: Sparse prospective data guide next choices; options include switch chemo, targeted agents if biomarker‑positive, or clinical trials.  \n   - Evidence: Real‑world sequencing data and subgroup analyses are emerging; THOR erdafitinib Asian subanalysis shows benefit for FGFR3 patients (context).  \n   - Differentiate: Avelumab is not a post‑EV salvage in the approved label; focus on trials and RWE capture.  \n   - Position: Suggest collecting local sequencing outcomes and consider registry studies to inform future recommendations.\n\n8. Objection: \"Maintenance after only 3 cycles of chemo is insufficient (DISCUS will clarify).\"  \n   - Acknowledge: Duration of induction chemo before maintenance remains debated.  \n   - Context: DISCUS (LBA109) randomizes 3 vs 6 cycles prior to avelumab maintenance — results will shape practice.  \n   - Evidence: Currently, institutional practice varies; JAVELIN allowed 4–6 cycles in pivotal program.  \n   - Differentiate: avelumab’s efficacy was shown following standard chemo exposures used in trials; we will incorporate DISCUS results when available.  \n   - Position: Use provisional guidance and emphasize individualized decisions until trial readout.\n\n9. Objection: \"Ave+SG toxicity is unacceptable to my patients.\"  \n   - Acknowledge: Ave+SG grade ≥3 TRAEs were high in the interim.  \n   - Context: Trade‑offs between PFS and toxicity should be discussed; some patients prioritize disease control even with toxicity.  \n   - Evidence: JAVELIN Medley 3083P interim shows high grade ≥3 AE rates with Ave+SG.  \n   - Differentiate: For frail or QoL‑sensitive patients, avelumab monotherapy maintenance remains a viable option with known tolerability.  \n   - Position: Suggest shared decision‑making and careful toxicity monitoring if considering Ave+SG.\n\n10. Objection: \"We should move resources to ADC adoption, not maintainers.\"  \n    - Acknowledge: ADCs are a major innovation and deserve attention.  \n    - Context: ADC uptake depends on logistic and clinical resources; maintenance remains evidence‑based for many patients.  \n    - Evidence: EV‑302 and ADC programs show strong results; AVENANCE RWE supports avelumab durability in routine practice.  \n    - Differentiate: A balanced system may need both ADC adoption programs and maintenance pathways — they are not mutually exclusive.  \n    - Position: Teams might map patient flows locally and plan phased adoption aligned with capacity.\n\n### Evidence Generation Priorities — suggested (framed as options)\n\nImmediate priorities (high strategic value, low resource requirement; start at/after ESMO):\n- Rapid post‑hoc analyses and slide decks for field teams:\n  - Compile JAVELIN Medley interim subgroup PFS vs safety by baseline risk; produce balanced Q&A for MSLs.\n  - Produce a 1‑page comparative evidence sheet: chemo→avelumab maintenance vs EV+P first‑line (key endpoints, populations, toxicity profiles).\n- RWE quick wins:\n  - Use existing datasets to create a sequencing snapshot (e.g., proportion of patients receiving chemo→avelumab vs EV+P in key markets) to inform immediate forecasting and payer conversations.\n- MRD operational primer:\n  - Develop a concise MRD/utDNA primer (timing, platforms, interpretation) to support KOL discussions and MSL education.\n\nMedium‑term opportunities (6–18 months; moderate investment):\n- Prospective observational registry to capture real‑world sequencing outcomes (chemo→avelumab vs EV+P first‑line) and post‑ADC progression patterns (non‑interventional).\n- Diagnostic partnerships:\n  - Work with central labs or validated vendors to evaluate NECTIN‑4 amplification/IHC harmonization and ctDNA/utDNA workflows in pilot centers.\n- Investigator‑initiated studies:\n  - Support pragmatic studies in frail/ECOG≥2 populations comparing tolerability/outcomes of maintenance vs ADC strategies.\n\nLonger‑term considerations (only if strategically critical; higher resource requirement):\n- Consider a biomarker‑stratified prospective study that examines maintenance strategies in NECTIN‑4‑low vs NECTIN‑4‑amp patients (only if assay standardization and clinical need justify sponsor investment).\n- Investment in trials to evaluate salvage options post‑ADC progression; however, avoid duplicating competitor registrational programs and prioritize unmet‑need niches.\n\n### At ESMO: Priority Engagement (who & what)\n- Priority KOLs to meet (short list and focal topics):\n  - Andrea Necchi (IRCCS San Raffaele) — neoadjuvant and organ‑preserving strategies (LBA110, LBA112).

Medical Affairs may want to prioritize RWE, biomarker operationalization, and balanced toxicity vs efficacy dialogues so that avelumab’s value proposition remains clear in both chemo‑first and mixed‑pathway practices. Use the abstracts above to inform real‑time field conversations — and plan immediate post‑ESMO synthesis (48–72 hours) to convert conference signals into actionable MA materials."

    "analysis": "# Strategic Briefing: TGCT — ESMO 2025\n\nPre‑conference briefing based on ESMO 2025 abstracts (2694P; 2690MO). Conference: Oct 17–21, 2025. Date of this brief: 14 Oct 2025.\n\n## Executive summary\n\nPimicotinib is our lead CSF1R small‑molecule for symptomatic, unresectable tenosynovial giant cell tumour (TGCT). The MANEUVER Phase III program previously met its primary endpoint (Week 25 ORR 54.0% vs 3.2% placebo) and an extended analysis is being presented at ESMO (abstract 2690MO). That extended dataset (data cutoff 12 Mar 2025) reports strong RECIST and TVS response rates and continued COA improvements — items we should highlight in clinical discussions.\n\nBased on ESMO 2025 abstracts, the two items to watch are: (1) vimseltinib (MOTION) 2‑year follow‑up (abstract 2694P) reporting durability with ORR 48% by RECIST and 81% by TVS at ~2 years and a tolerability statement that most TEAEs were grade 1/2; and (2) pimicotinib (MANEUVER) extended results (2690MO) reporting RECIST ORR 76.2% (95% CI 63.8–86.0) and meaningful COA improvements at Week 49 with no evidence of cholestatic hepatotoxicity/DILI in the abstract. Both abstracts omit translational biomarker data and full AE tables in the public text — a recurring gap.\n\nTop tactical priorities emerging for Medical Affairs at and immediately after ESMO: (A) secure full slide decks and AE tables for both abstracts the moment they’re available, (B) prioritize attendance/engagement at Xiaohui Niu’s mini‑oral (pimicotinib) and Sebastian Bauer’s poster (vimseltinib), and (C) prepare balanced comparative analyses (MAIC / indirect comparisons) and COA/HEOR messages that emphasize durability, function, and hepatic safety while explicitly noting cross‑trial limitations.\n\n---\n\n## Pre‑ESMO 2025 TGCT landscape\n\n### Current treatment paradigm\n- Primary curative approach: surgical resection/synovectomy when feasible. When surgery is morbid or disease is unresectable, systemic CSF1/CSF1R pathway inhibition is the accepted medical option.\n- Established evidence:\n  - Pexidartinib (ENLIVEN, Phase 3; randomized n≈120) showed a centrally reviewed RECIST ORR of ~39% vs 0% with placebo at Week 25, plus improvements in ROM and symptoms — but significant mixed/cholestatic hepatotoxicity led to a REMS program and constrained uptake.\n  - Newer oral CSF1R inhibitors have focused on improving tolerability and PROs while matching or improving efficacy. Vimseltinib and pimicotinib have been evaluated in randomized Phase III programs (MOTION and MANEUVER respectively).\n- Diagnostics/testing: TGCT diagnosis remains histopathologic (including CSF1 overexpression in many cases) and radiologic assessment (MRI) with assessments by RECIST v1.1 and specialized Tumor Volume Score (TVS) often used in trials. No validated predictive companion diagnostic is available in routine practice.\n- Market access/uptake: clinician adoption is driven by perceived efficacy, functional benefit (ROM, pain), and importantly hepatic safety/monitoring burden. Pexidartinib’s REMS highlighted the impact of safety monitoring requirements on access; new agents with cleaner hepatic profiles or lower monitoring burden can gain faster uptake.\n\n### Competitive positioning (how pimicotinib stacks up)\n- Pimicotinib (MANEUVER program) — ESMO abstract 2690MO (extended analysis, cutoff 12 Mar 2025):\n  - Patients randomized to pimicotinib at baseline (n=63) had RECIST ORR 76.2% (95% CI 63.8–86.0) and TVS ORR 74.6% (95% CI 62.1–84.7) with median follow‑up 62 weeks; median DOR not reached.\n  - COAs at Week 49: active ROM mean change +16.44 (n=44), worst stiffness NRS −3.70 (n=46), worst pain BPI −2.56 (n=46), PROMIS‑PF +6.55 (n=49).\n  - Safety note in abstract: “no evidence of cholestatic hepatotoxicity or drug‑induced liver injury” and no hair/skin hypopigmentation; 6.3% discontinued for TEAE.\n- Vimseltinib (MOTION program) — ESMO abstract 2694P (2‑year update; cutoff 22 Feb 2025):\n  - Patients randomized to vimseltinib in Part 1 (n=83) show ORR 48% (RECIST; 95% CI 37–59) and 81% (TVS; 95% CI 71–89) after up to 2 years; median DOR not reached; median treatment duration 23.6 months.\n  - Safety in abstract summarized as “consistent with prior reports” and mostly grade 1/2 TEAEs; no AE table provided in the abstract text.\n- Pexidartinib (ENLIVEN and regional data) remains in clinical use but with constrained uptake because of hepatotoxicity/monitoring demands (ENLIVEN: ORR ~39% vs placebo at Week 25; East Asian Phase 3 N=40 showed RECIST ORR 22.5% and TVS ORR 47.5% and high rates of transaminase elevations).\n- High‑level interpretation:\n  - Pimicotinib’s extended results show a high RECIST ORR and durable responses plus numeric COA improvements — potential advantages on both efficacy and patient function if the signal is confirmed with full safety tables and broader follow‑up.\n  - Vimseltinib’s 2‑year durability claim is strategically important — it may set expectations for long‑term control. Cross‑trial comparisons are unreliable; messaging should emphasise head‑to‑head limitations.\n\n### Evidence gaps and unmet needs\n- Translational/predictive biomarkers for selection or resistance: absent in both abstracts.\n- Granular safety data and management algorithms: neither abstract provides full AE incidence/grade tables or lab‑abnormality trends in the public text.\n- Surgical conversion / operability metrics: not reported; surgeons/teams need data on conversion rates and timing.\n- Post‑progression sequencing and rechallenge strategies: limited published data (some pexidartinib real‑world/rechallenge reports exist but not definitive).\n- Head‑to‑head comparative effectiveness: no randomized head‑to‑head trials presented; indirect comparisons will be required for payers.\n- Real‑world generalisability: geographic skew (MANEUVER ~48% China) and trial populations limit instant extrapolation.\n\n---\n\n## What's being presented at ESMO 2025 in TGCT\n\n### High‑priority studies relevant to our portfolio (actual abstract data, attributed)\n1. Abstract 2690MO — MANEUVER (pimicotinib) — Extended efficacy and safety from the Phase III MANEUVER trial\n   - What the abstract reports (data cutoff 12 Mar 2025):\n     - Patients randomized to pimicotinib at baseline (n=63): RECIST ORR 76.2% (95% CI 63.8–86.0); TVS ORR 74.6% (95% CI 62.1–84.7).\n     - Median follow‑up 62 weeks; median DOR not reached (range 0.03–19.81 months).\n     - COAs at end of Part 2 (Week 49): active ROM mean change +16.44 (n=44); worst stiffness NRS 3.70 (n=46); worst pain BPI 2.56 (n=46); PROMIS‑PF +6.55 (n=49).\n     - Safety statement: no evidence of cholestatic hepatotoxicity/DILI; no hair/skin hypopigmentation; 4 patients (6.3%) discontinued for TEAE; “no new safety signals” in extended follow‑up.\n     - Legal entity on abstract: Abbisko Therapeutics Co. Ltd. (abstract funding listed as Abbisko).\n   - Evidence gap addressed:\n     - Longer‑term efficacy signal and sustained PRO/COA benefit out to ~1+ year.\n     - Partial hepatic safety reassurance in the data presented (abstract level).\n   - Competitive implications:\n     - High RECIST ORR and COA durability support pimicotinib’s clinical value proposition vs older agents; absence of DILI language may be used cautiously as a differentiator versus pexidartinib.\n   - How Medical Affairs can use it:\n     - Prepare balanced Q&A on COA clinical meaningfulness and request full AE tables/KM curves from investigators/sponsor for internal analyses.\n\n2. Abstract 2694P — MOTION (vimseltinib) — Long‑term efficacy and safety: 2‑year results\n   - What the abstract reports (data cutoff 22 Feb 2025):\n     - Patients randomized to vimseltinib in Part 1 (n=83): RECIST ORR 48% (95% CI 37–59); TVS ORR 81% (95% CI 71–89).\n     - Median treatment duration 23.6 months (range 2.0–36.0); median DOR not reached (ranges reported).\n     - Safety: “consistent with prior reports”; most TEAEs were grade 1/2 (no AE table in the abstract text).\n     - Abstract notes vimseltinib is approved in the US for TGCT (per abstract wording).\n   - Evidence gap addressed:\n     - Durable disease control to ~2 years for an oral CSF1R inhibitor.\n   - Competitive implications:\n     - Vimseltinib’s 2‑year durability and TVS‑high ORR will be used by clinicians/payers to benchmark long‑term control. Lack of AE granularity is a limitation but the 2‑year timepoint is a powerful messaging point for competitors.\n   - How Medical Affairs can use it:\n     - Anticipate KOL questions on long‑term safety and PRO durability; local teams may want to request full safety tables and COA curves.\n\n### Competitive intelligence summary (what matters)\n- The two Phase III programs dominate the ESMO TGCT abstracts: vimseltinib (MOTION) with a 2‑year durability message and pimicotinib (MANEUVER) with a high RECIST ORR and explicit COA gains at Week 49 plus an abstract‑level hepatic safety statement.\n- Threat level: moderate‑high for vimseltinib because of the 2‑year durability message and US approval claim in the abstract; moderate for pexidartinib because of its earlier randomized evidence but constrained by hepatic toxicity.\n- Tactical implication: during ESMO, Medical Affairs will want to secure full datasets/slides and prioritize head‑to‑head indirect analyses and HEOR/PRO narratives that stress the clinical and safety differentiators of pimicotinib — but always with cross‑trial caveats.\n\n### Evidence gaps: what will be addressed vs what remains\n- Likely addressed by these abstracts (partially): longer‑term durability (vimseltinib) and medium‑term durability + COAs (pimicotinib); abstract‑level reassurance on hepatotoxicity for pimicotinib.\n- Likely to remain unanswered after ESMO:\n  - Predictive biomarkers and mechanisms of resistance.\n  - Full granular safety tables (grade ≥3 TEAEs, lab trends) if not included in full presentations.\n  - Surgical conversion statistics and post‑progression sequencing strategies.\n  - Head‑to‑head randomized comparative data.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic considerations for Medical Affairs\n\nNote: these are strategic options and discussion prompts to support field teams and leadership. Language intentionally suggestive (may, could, might).\n\n### Ten strategic questions for KOL engagement (with context, which abstract informs, and how pimicotinib relates)\n\n1. Question: How do you interpret RECIST v1.1 vs TVS response rates for clinical decision‑making in TGCT (operability, symptom control)?\n   - Why it matters: vimseltinib 2694P reports RECIST ORR 48% vs TVS 81%; pimicotinib 2690MO reports RECIST ORR 76.2% and TVS 74.6%.\n   - How pimicotinib relates: use the differences to probe which metric surgeons/oncologists prioritize and to frame pimicotinib’s RECIST and TVS profile in that context.\n\n2. Question: What magnitude and durability of ROM and PROM changes translate into meaningful clinical decisions (e.g., avoiding surgery)?\n   - Why: MANEUVER reports active ROM +16.44 and PROMIS‑PF +6.55 at Week 49.\n   - How pimicotinib relates: ask clinicians whether those numeric COA changes meet their thresholds for functional improvement.\n\n3. Question: How do you weigh hepatic safety signals vs efficacy when selecting a CSF1R inhibitor?\n   - Why: pexidartinib’s REMS vs pimicotinib’s abstract statement of “no evidence of cholestatic hepatotoxicity/DILI”.\n   - How pimicotinib relates: probe acceptable monitoring regimens and whether a favorable hepatic profile materially changes prescribing.\n\n4. Question: For patients who respond, what is your practice on treatment discontinuation, surveillance, and rechallenge?\n   - Why: pexidartinib rechallenge/discontinuation data exist but limited; pimicotinib and vimseltinib long‑term durability data are emerging.\n   - How pimicotinib relates: explore interest in planned discontinuation strategies and data collection opportunities.\n\n5. Question: Would you accept tumor downstaging (shrinkage) as an endpoint for surgical conversion trials in TGCT?\n   - Why: neither abstract reports conversion-to‑surgery rates.\n   - How pimicotinib relates: discuss whether pimicotinib’s ORR could support a surgical conversion study.\n\n6. Question: Which patient subgroups (joint site, diffuse vs nodular, prior local therapy) are most important to characterize in subgroup analyses?\n   - Why: abstracts lack detailed subgroup breakdowns.\n   - How pimicotinib relates: consider generating subgroup analyses post‑hoc and discuss what subgroup data clinicians want to see.\n\n7. Question: What biomarkers would you prioritize to predict response or resistance to CSF1R inhibitors?\n   - Why: no translational correlates in either abstract.\n   - How pimicotinib relates: discuss possible tissue or blood biomarkers (CSF1 expression, macrophage signatures, ctDNA) to include in future programs.\n\n8. Question: How do you manage quality‑of‑life trade‑offs when a patient has partial radiographic response but persistent functional limitations?\n   - Why: COA improvement is key to treatment value beyond ORR.\n   - How pimicotinib relates: use pimicotinib’s PROMIS‑PF and ROM improvements to discuss clinical interpretation.\n\n9. Question: What real‑world adherence concerns arise with once‑daily versus intermittent (twice‑weekly) dosing schedules?\n   - Why: pimicotinib dosing 50 mg daily vs vimseltinib 30 mg twice weekly.\n   - How pimicotinib relates: gather clinician preference and perceptions of adherence and monitoring burden.\n\n10. Question: From a payer perspective, which endpoints (ORR, sustained ROM, surgery avoidance, fewer labs) sway reimbursement decisions in your region?\n    - Why: HEOR messaging must be tailored to payer priorities.\n    - How pimicotinib relates: discuss which data pimicotinib should prioritize for local dossiers.\n\n### Ten high‑value discussion topics (angles, evidence, how pimicotinib fits)\n\n1. Topic: RECIST vs TVS in TGCT\n   - Angles: measurement sensitivity for irregular synovial lesions; impact on reported ORR; implication for regulatory/payer endpoints.\n   - Evidence: vimseltinib 2694P (RECIST 48% vs TVS 81%); pimicotinib 2690MO (RECIST 76.2%, TVS 74.6%).\n   - Pimicotinib fit: stress both RECIST and TVS responses and discuss why both matter to multi‑disciplinary teams.\n\n2. Topic: Durability of response (DOR not reached signals)\n   - Angles: interpreting “median DOR not reached” given different follow‑ups; comparing KM curves and censoring.\n   - Evidence: vimseltinib median treatment 23.6 months (DOR NR); pimicotinib median follow‑up 62 weeks (DOR NR).\n   - Pimicotinib fit: request and discuss KM DOR curves; use duration data to frame chronic‑disease management.\n\n3. Topic: Hepatic safety and monitoring burden\n   - Angles: real-world feasibility of intense LFT monitoring; potential to reduce lab burden with safer agents.\n   - Evidence: pexidartinib ENLIVEN hepatotoxicity/REMS; pimicotinib abstract claims no cholestatic hepatotoxicity/DILI.\n   - Pimicotinib fit: discuss data that would support fewer labs or lighter monitoring in a label.\n\n4. Topic: Patient‑reported outcomes — clinical meaningfulness\n   - Angles: MCID thresholds for PROMIS‑PF and BPI; translating numeric change into patient decisions.\n   - Evidence: pimicotinib PROMIS‑PF +6.55 at Week 49; vimseltinib earlier COA signals at Week 25 (prior reporting).\n   - Pimicotinib fit: propose presenting responder analyses (e.g., proportion achieving MCID).\n\n5. Topic: Surgical conversion and multi‑disciplinary care\n   - Angles: timing of systemic therapy before resection; criteria for conversion; collaboration with orthopaedics/plastics.\n   - Evidence gap: neither abstract reports conversion rates.\n   - Pimicotinib fit: discuss investigator interest in formalizing surgical conversion endpoints.\n\n6. Topic: Dosing schedule tradeoffs (daily vs intermittent)\n   - Angles: adherence, toxicity management, PK/PD, real‑world convenience.\n   - Evidence: pimicotinib 50 mg qd (MANEUVER); vimseltinib 30 mg twice weekly (MOTION).\n   - Pimicotinib fit: use dosing convenience as a discussion point without overclaiming.\n\n7. Topic: Rechallenge and treatment holidays\n   - Angles: durability off therapy, predictors of durable control, retreatment efficacy/safety.\n   - Evidence: pexidartinib discontinuation/rechallenge phase 4 studies (real‑world).\n   - Pimicotinib fit: propose RWE to track off‑treatment durability and re‑initiation outcomes.\n\n8. Topic: Geographic variation and generalisability\n   - Angles: regional differences in trial populations (MANEUVER ~48% China) and implications for labeling/market access.\n   - Evidence: pimicotinib baseline geography reported in 2690MO.\n   - Pimicotinib fit: discuss plans for regional RWE and bridging analyses.\n\n9. Topic: Biomarkers and resistance mechanisms\n   - Angles: tissue vs blood biomarkers; tumor microenvironment macrophage signatures; early translational endpoints.\n   - Evidence gap: absent in both abstracts.\n   - Pimicotinib fit: propose investigator‑led translational substudies or retrospective tissue analyses.\n\n10. Topic: Health economics — cost of monitoring vs clinical value\n    - Angles: modeling lab monitoring costs (pexidartinib REMS) vs cost of improved function (less surgery, less rehab).\n    - Evidence: pexidartinib REMS impact; pimicotinib COA improvements may reduce downstream costs.\n    - Pimicotinib fit: suggest early HEOR modelling focused on monitoring cost offsets and surgery‑avoidance scenarios.\n\n### Ten objection‑handling frameworks (scenario → structured response)\nFormat per scenario: Acknowledge → Context → Evidence → Differentiation → Strategic positioning (non‑directive).\n\n1. Scenario: “Vimseltinib’s 2‑year data shows durable control — why choose pimicotinib?”\n   - Acknowledge: Agree durability is a key priority.\n   - Context: Note differences in sample size (vimseltinib n=83 vs pimicotinib n=63), follow‑up length (vimseltinib median treatment 23.6 months; MANEUVER median follow‑up 62 weeks), and endpoint measurement nuances (RECIST vs TVS).\n   - Evidence: Point to pimicotinib’s RECIST ORR 76.2% and COA improvements at Week 49.\n   - Differentiation: Highlight pimicotinib’s explicit abstract‑level statement of no cholestatic hepatotoxicity/DILI (subject to full safety tables).\n   - Position: Suggest comparing full datasets (KM curves, AE tables) before drawing clinical conclusions.\n\n2. Scenario: “Pexidartinib has longer published experience — aren’t we duplicating a known approach?”\n   - Acknowledge: Pexidartinib established class proof‑of‑concept.\n   - Context: Pexidartinib ENLIVEN demonstrated benefit but brought significant hepatotoxicity and REMS constraints.\n   - Evidence: pexidartinib ENLIVEN ORR ~39% at Week 25; East Asian N=40 RECIST ORR 22.5% with notable transaminase elevations.\n   - Differentiation: Pimicotinib’s MANEUVER abstract indicates higher RECIST ORR and an absence of cholestatic DILI in the extended dataset.\n   - Position: Frame pimicotinib as attempting to improve tolerability while delivering meaningful efficacy.\n\n3. Scenario: “We don’t have biomarker data — how do you target therapy?”\n   - Acknowledge: Good point — predictive biomarkers would improve selection.\n   - Context: Neither ESMO abstract reports translational markers.\n   - Evidence: Current selection remains clinical/histologic.\n   - Differentiation: Propose discussing planned/possible translational analyses and RWE collection to identify correlates of response.\n   - Position: Position pimicotinib as suitable across standard diagnostic workflows while we pursue biomarker work.\n\n4. Scenario: “Those COA numbers look small — are they clinically meaningful?”\n   - Acknowledge: Numbers need interpretation in clinical context.\n   - Context: MANEUVER reports PROMIS‑PF +6.55 and ROM +16.44 at Week 49.\n   - Evidence: Ask about MCID thresholds for PROMIS‑PF and share responder analyses (proportion meeting MCID) when available.\n   - Differentiation: Emphasize both objective ROM gains and patient‑reported improvements as complementary signals.\n   - Position: Suggest clinicians review raw score distributions and responder rates once full data are available.\n\n5. Scenario: “How can we be confident about hepatic safety given small sample and limited follow‑up?”\n   - Acknowledge: Valid concern.\n   - Context: Abstract level statements are reassuring but require full lab‑trend data.\n   - Evidence: For example, pimicotinib abstract states “no evidence of cholestatic hepatotoxicity/DILI” and reports 6.3% discontinuations for TEAE.\n   - Differentiation: Request full LFT trend tables, grade ≥3 AE rates, and post‑marketing surveillance plans to assess confidence.\n   - Position: Recommend waiting for full safety datasets for definitive comparisons.\n\n6. Scenario: “Why should payers pay more for pimicotinib if vimseltinib shows similar long‑term benefit?”\n   - Acknowledge: Cost‑effectiveness is a payer priority.\n   - Context: Payers will weigh efficacy, safety (monitoring costs), and PRO impact.\n   - Evidence: Provide pimicotinib’s COA improvements and the abstract’s hepatic safety statement as inputs to HEOR modelling.\n   - Differentiation: Model potential reductions in monitoring or downstream surgical costs as value drivers.\n   - Position: Offer to share early HEOR work for payer dialogues.\n\n7. Scenario: “We don’t have post‑progression sequencing data — how to manage after progression?”\n   - Acknowledge: This is a current clinical blind spot.\n   - Context: Abstracts do not report subsequent therapies or response to second‑line approaches.\n   - Evidence: Point to limited pexidartinib rechallenge literature and propose collecting such data in registries.\n   - Differentiation: Emphasize pimicotinib’s durable responses as a reason to delay progression and the need to collect sequence data prospectively.\n   - Position: Suggest collaborative registries to capture real‑world sequences and outcomes.\n\n8. Scenario: “The MANEUVER population had nearly 48% Chinese patients—how generalisable is the data to my practice?”\n   - Acknowledge: Geographic composition matters for external validity.\n   - Context: MANEUVER baseline: 47.9% located in China.\n   - Evidence: Recommend subgroup analyses by region and RWE from local sites.\n   - Differentiation: Propose global RWE plans to support regional generalizability.\n   - Position: Encourage use of local data where available to support decision‑making.\n\n9. Scenario: “Intermittent dosing (vimseltinib) vs daily dosing — which is better for toxicity management?”\n   - Acknowledge: Different schedules may influence tolerability and adherence.\n   - Context: Vimseltinib 30 mg twice weekly (MOTION) vs pimicotinib 50 mg once daily (MANEUVER).\n   - Evidence: Discuss investigator experience and AE profiles (request full tables).\n   - Differentiation: Note that once‑daily dosing may be simpler for adherence but intermittent dosing may allow lower cumulative exposure — both hypotheses worth examining.\n   - Position: Offer to collect adherence and toxicity management data prospectively.\n\n10. Scenario: “If a patient needs a rapid functional improvement (e.g., to return to work), which drug would you choose?”\n    - Acknowledge: Time to clinical benefit matters.\n    - Context: Time to response and PRO kinetics are not fully reported in the abstracts.\n    - Evidence: MANEUVER COAs at Week 49 show meaningful changes; ask about earlier timepoints (Week 13/25).\n    - Differentiation: Suggest evaluating early timepoint PROs and ROM curves from both programs.\n    - Position: Suggest a data request focused on time to first clinically meaningful PRO improvement.\n\n### Evidence generation priorities (recommended sequencing)\n\nImmediate priorities (high strategic value, low resource requirement — actionable during/shortly after ESMO)\n- Secure full slide decks, AE tables, Kaplan‑Meier curves, and poster PDFs from presenters (Xiaohui Niu, Sebastian Bauer) at ESMO sessions.\n- Rapid internal evidence summary (48–72 hours post presentation) to update MSL Q&A and field slide decks with exact numbers and caveats.\n- Run a pre‑planned matching‑adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) / systematic literature crosswalk to contextualize ORR and DOR across MANEUVER, MOTION, and ENLIVEN (explicitly document limitations).\n- Prepare COA responder analyses and MCID translations for clinicians and payers using MANEUVER COA numbers.\n- Convene a rapid virtual advisory panel (external KOLs) to interpret COA clinical meaningfulness and measurement preferences.\n\nMedium‑term opportunities (moderate investment, 6–18 months)\n- Sponsor/partner a prospective, multi‑center RWE registry capturing discontinuation/rechallenge, real‑world safety (LFT trends), surgical conversion rates, and sequencing after CSF1R inhibitors (design informed by pexidartinib discontinuation studies).\n- Fund investigator‑led translational studies (retrospective tissue and blood) to explore CSF1 expression, macrophage infiltration, inflammatory signatures, and potential resistance mechanisms using MANEUVER/MOTION samples (if accessible).\n- Conduct regional subgroup analyses (e.g., China vs non‑China) and publish to support generalisability claims.\n- Develop HEOR models comparing monitoring costs (pexidartinib REMS) vs clinical benefits (PROMIS‑PF, ROM) to inform payer dossiers.\n\nLonger‑term considerations (major investment — consider only if Tier 1/2 findings justify)\n- Consider a pragmatic, prospective comparative‑effectiveness study (real‑world, multi‑center) that evaluates clinical outcomes, PROs, and healthcare resource use for pimicotinib versus other CSF1R agents — positioned as outcomes research rather than registration.\n- If translational markers emerge, consider a biomarker‑driven prospective trial to enrich populations likelier to benefit.\n- Evaluate a surgical‑conversion endpoint trial design (systemic therapy → planned surgery) if surgeons/KOLs confirm clinical utility and feasibility.\n\n### At ESMO: priority engagement (who/when/what to ask)\n- Must‑attend sessions:\n  - Xiaohui Niu — 2690MO (MANEUVER mini‑oral): 10/17/2025, 16:33–16:38 (Essen Auditorium — Hall 7.2a). Focus: request full COA tables, time‑to‑response curves, LFT trend data, and geographic subgroup breakdowns.\n  - Sebastian Bauer — 2694P (MOTION poster): 10/20/2025, 12:00–13:00 (Hall 25). Focus: ask for the 2‑year COA/PRO numbers, full AE tables (by grade and laboratory trends), and details on reasons for discontinuation.\n- Suggested discussion points to raise with both presenters:\n  - Will full AE tables and KM curves be made available / published soon?\n  - Can they share subgroup analyses (joint site, diffuse vs nodular, prior treatments)?\n  - Any available translational samples or plans for biomarker analyses?\n  - Details on surgical conversion — did any patients become operable after treatment?\n  - Practical management algorithms for LFTs and common TEAEs.\n- Engagement tone: non‑promotional, collaborative — seek to learn, share methodological perspectives, and explore investigator interest in RWE/translational partnerships.\n\n### Post‑ESMO: communication and dissemination (suggested immediate actions)\n- Within 48–72 hours after presentations: host an internal cross‑functional debrief (Medical Science, Clinical, Regulatory, HEOR) to capture slide‑level data and decide next analytic steps.\n- Update MSL Q&A documents with factual abstract numbers and a short script on how to discuss cross‑trial limitations; distribute to field teams before follow‑up KOL meetings.\n- Prepare a neutral, factual clinician summary (“what these abstracts show” and “what they do not show”) for KOL/payer conversations.\n- Flag priority data requests to external investigators (full datasets, supplementary slides) and document agreements/next steps for access.\n\n---\n\n## Leadership considerations\n\n### Competitive monitoring (what to watch and suggested triggers)\n- If vimseltinib’s full presentation/paper shows new late hepatotoxicity or other serious safety signals:\n  - Trigger: publication of full safety tables or regulatory safety alerts.\n  - Consideration: leadership may want to emphasise pimicotinib’s abstract‑level hepatic safety claim in HEOR and payer conversations (pending confirmatory full data).\n- If vimseltinib obtains EU approval or guideline inclusion referencing 2‑year durability:\n  - Trigger: regulatory approval announcement or formal guideline updates (ESMO/NCCN).\n  - Consideration: leadership may want to accelerate regional access planning and strengthen local payer engagements with pimicotinib comparative dossiers.\n- If pimicotinib full data confirm high RECIST ORR, robust PRO durability, and favorable hepatic safety:\n  - Trigger: release of full MANEUVER presentation/publication showing complete safety tables and KM curves.\n  - Consideration: leadership may want to prioritise HEOR investment (cost‑offset models) and targeted publication campaigns.\n- If payers repeatedly ask for head‑to‑head comparisons:\n  - Trigger: payer feedback indicating preference for direct comparative evidence.\n  - Consideration: leadership may want to fund MAIC/NMA analyses and targeted RWE comparative studies.\n\n### Strategic investment areas to consider (options, not mandates)\n- Invest in HEOR modelling that quantifies monitoring costs (LFTs/REMS) vs functional gains (ROM, PROMIS‑PF) to drive payer conversations.\n- Prioritise translational biomarker partnerships with investigator centers (sample access from MANEUVER/MOTION) to identify predictive markers.\n- Expand RWE infrastructure for TGCT to capture discontinuation/rechallenge, surgical conversion, and long‑term PROs (could be investigator‑led with sponsor support).\n- Allocate resources for rapid publication and medical education if full data confirm differentiation.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\nKey abstracts (ESMO 2025)\n- 2690MO — “Extended efficacy and safety from the phase III MANEUVER trial of pimicotinib in patients with tenosynovial giant cell tumour (TGCT)”\n  - Key data (abstract): RECIST ORR 76.2% (n=63; 95% CI 63.8–86.0); TVS ORR 74.6% (95% CI 62.1–84.7); median follow‑up 62 weeks; COA improvements at Week 49 (active ROM +16.44; PROMIS‑PF +6.55); no evidence of cholestatic hepatotoxicity/DILI reported in abstract.

Ltd.\n- 2694P — “Long‑term efficacy and safety of vimseltinib in patients with TGCT: 2‑year results from the MOTION phase III trial”\n  - Key data (abstract): RECIST ORR 48% (n=83; 95% CI 37–59); TVS ORR 81% (95% CI 71–89); median treatment duration 23.6 months; DOR not reached; safety “consistent with prior reports” and mostly grade 1/2 TEAEs. Data cutoff 22 Feb 2025. Funded by Deciphera.\n\nPriority KOLs to engage at ESMO\n- Xiaohui Niu — Beijing Jishuitan Hospital / National Center for Orthopedics\n  - ESMO activity: presenter for 2690MO (MANEUVER pimicotinib mini‑oral) — 10/17/2025, 16:33–16:38.\n  - Why engage: Pimicotinib investigator; key source for PRO interpretation, safety management, and regional generalisability.\n- Sebastian Bauer — German Cancer Consortium / University Hospital Essen\n  - ESMO activity: presenter for 2694P (MOTION vimseltinib poster) — 10/20/2025, 12:00–13:00.\n  - Why engage: Lead MOTION investigator with 2‑year durability data; important comparator voice for EU opinion leaders.\n\n---\n\nFinal notes (tone and caution)\n- All numeric values and safety statements above are reported in ESMO 2025 abstracts 2690MO and 2694P (data cutoffs as cited). Abstracts omit full datasets; conclusions should be framed as provisional until full presentations and peer‑reviewed publications are available.\n- Cross‑trial comparisons can be useful for hypothesis generation but are not definitive; any external comparative claims should state methodology and limitations (differences in follow‑up, populations, endpoints).\n- Medical Affairs may want to prioritise evidence requests, COA/HEOR work, and investigator engagement at ESMO — with the explicit aim of rapidly obtaining and reviewing full datasets to inform KOL, payer, and internal communications after presentations."

    "analysis": "# Strategic Briefing: Merkel Cell — ESMO 2025\n\nPre‑conference briefing based on ESMO 2025 abstracts.\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nAvelumab (Bavencio) enters ESMO 2025 as an established first‑line PD‑L1 option for advanced/metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) with long‑term durability signals from JAVELIN Merkel cohorts (e.g., part B 4‑year follow‑up: n=116, median follow‑up 54.3 months, median OS 20.3 months; 4‑yr OS rate 38%) and supporting real‑world experience. The program also includes an ongoing adjuvant development effort (ADAM) that directly competes conceptually with late‑breaking adjuvant PD‑1 data being presented at the meeting.\n\nBased on ESMO 2025 abstracts the three items to track closely are: LBA56 (STAMP — phase III adjuvant pembrolizumab; proffered late‑breaking oral with no full abstract data released), 1739eTiP (PANDORA — phase II pembrolizumab + platinum/etoposide chemo‑immunotherapy, early enrollment, no efficacy readouts yet), and 1669P (large retrospective cohort proposing an organ‑risk‑based M‑stage with liver, bone and pancreas metastases independently prognostic). These data could (1) accelerate adoption of adjuvant PD‑1 if STAMP shows positive DFS/EFS, (2) seed debate about chemo‑induction strategies for high‑burden disease, and (3) shift how trials and surveillance are stratified if the proposed M‑stage is validated.\n\nTop near‑term priorities for Medical Affairs: 1) attend and rapidly interpret LBA56 at ESMO and prepare a comparative scientific crosswalk versus ADAM; 2) gather granular PANDORA operational/safety details and probe for biomarker/virus‑status data; 3) validate the prognostic claims in 1669P with external cohorts and translate implications into trial stratification advice and field Q&A materials. During and after ESMO the team may want to focus on MRD/ctDNA integration, external validation of organ‑risk staging, and prioritized KOL engagements (Mehnert, Khaddour, Oldani).\n\n---\n\n## Pre‑ESMO 2025 Merkel Cell Landscape\n\n### Current Treatment Paradigm\n- Systemic standard for unresectable regional or metastatic MCC is PD‑1/PD‑L1 monotherapy. Agents used routinely include pembrolizumab, nivolumab (guideline‑listed), retifanlimab (accelerated approval 2023), and avelumab (first approved in MCC, Bavencio).\n- Key supporting evidence:\n  - Avelumab — JAVELIN Merkel 200 part B (1L cohort) long‑term: n=116, median follow‑up 54.3 months; median OS 20.3 months; 4‑year OS 38% (PMID: 38744102).\n  - Pembrolizumab — KEYNOTE data in 1L/advanced disease report ORR ≈49%, median DOR ~39.8 months, mPFS ~9.3 months, mOS ~24.3 months in reported cohorts (PMID cited in background).\n  - Retifanlimab (POD1UM‑201) shows ORR 54.5% (n=101, 1L chemo‑naïve), suggesting multiple PD‑1 agents produce substantial ORR/DOR in 1L (PMID: 40796223).\n- Diagnostics and surveillance: MCPyV serology and tumor‑informed ctDNA have strong prognostic signal. A prospective tumor‑informed ctDNA assay reported high sensitivity (95% discovery / 94% validation) and strong NPV (~93–94%) for surveillance; ctDNA positivity confers high recurrence risk (HRs reported) — data that enable MRD‑guided strategies (PMID references in background).\n- Adjuvant landscape: sponsor‑ and investigator‑led adjuvant programs are active — ADAM (avelumab) is ongoing; STAMP (pembrolizumab, ECOG‑ACRIN EA6174) is presenting late‑breaking data at ESMO.\n\n### Competitive Positioning\n- Avelumab strengths:\n  - First‑in‑class regulatory history and established real‑world usage.\n  - Durable outcomes in long‑term follow‑up from JAVELIN Merkel cohorts (median OS and multi‑year survival rates).\n  - Mechanistic distinction as an anti‑PD‑L1 IgG1 with intact Fc (potential relevance for translational messaging in certain combination rationales).\n- Competitive pressures:\n  - Pembrolizumab has broad clinical adoption and now has a late‑breaking adjuvant dataset (LBA56 STAMP) coming to ESMO — this may influence perioperative standard‑of‑care decisions and payer expectations.\n  - Retifanlimab and nivolumab have shown high ORRs/durable responses in different cohorts, tightening the 1L class competition.\n  - Emerging chemo‑IO (PANDORA) could create a niche expectation for rapid disease control in high‑burden/symptomatic patients if early signals are compelling.\n- Current market dynamics: stable but competitive — avelumab holds a defensible 1L position, but adjuvant readouts for PD‑1 could intensify competition in the perioperative setting where ADAM is active.\n\n### Evidence Gaps and Unmet Needs\n- Prospective biomarker‑driven adjuvant selection (ctDNA or MCPyV serology) — important to avoid overtreatment in low‑risk patients and to enrich adjuvant trials.\n- Validation of the proposed organ‑risk M‑stage (liver, bone, pancreas) in independent cohorts and its operational impact on staging/trial stratification.\n- Management strategies for primary IO non‑responders and post‑IO progression — limited prospective data on optimal sequencing (CTLA‑4 addition, ADCs, targeted therapies).\n- Data in key subpopulations: immunosuppressed patients, elderly/frail (ECOG ≥2), and CNS‑metastatic cohorts.\n- Prospective ctDNA‑guided interventional trials — absent from the ESMO abstracts being presented.\n\n---\n\n## What's Being Presented at ESMO 2025 in Merkel Cell\n\n### High‑Priority Studies Relevant to Our Portfolio\n\nLBA56 — ECOG‑ACRIN EA6174: STAMP — Surgically Treated Adjuvant Merkel Cell Carcinoma with Pembrolizumab (Phase III, proffered paper)\n- Abstract ID / Session: LBA56 — Proffered Paper (Janice M. Mehnert). Presentation: 10/20/2025 09:30–09:40, Cologne Auditorium.\n- What the abstract release shows: title and proffered status; full numerical efficacy/safety data were not provided in the abstract release.\n- What to expect at presentation: randomized phase III adjuvant readout — primary efficacy measures likely to include recurrence‑free survival / disease‑free survival / event‑free survival, with safety and subgroup analyses (virus status, immunosuppression) of high interest.\n- Evidence gap addressed: whether adjuvant PD‑1 reduces recurrence after complete resection — directly relevant to adjuvant avelumab (ADAM).\n- Competitive implications: a positive STAMP could establish PD‑1 adjuvant as standard and accelerate payer and guideline shifts; absence of biomarker/ctDNA details in the abstract release would leave room for differentiation around MRD guidance.\n- How Medical Affairs can use it:\n  - Attend LBA; secure slides and ask specifically about virus status, ctDNA/MRD use, immunosuppressed subgroup outcomes, and toxicity/discontinuation rates.\n  - Prepare a scientific crosswalk comparing STAMP design and endpoints with ADAM and identify where avelumab can differentiate (e.g., biomarker substudies, safety profile, dosing schedule).\n\n1739eTiP — PANDORA: Chemio‑immunotherapy in naïve advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (Phase II; NCT06086288)\n- Abstract ID / Session: 1739eTiP — ePoster (Simone Oldani). Poster session: 10/20/2025 12:00–13:00, Hall 25.\n- Key design details from abstract:\n  - Single‑arm, open‑label phase II; induction: 4 cycles pembrolizumab 200 mg + carboplatin/cisplatin + etoposide q3w; maintenance pembrolizumab 400 mg q6w up to 24 months.\n  - Simon minimax two‑stage design; planned N=35 (24 first stage, 11 second stage). Thresholds: proceed if ≥15 responses in first stage; considered worthy if ≥23 responses overall.\n  - Recruitment started Feb 2024; as of April 2025 enrolment = 13 patients. No efficacy ORR/PFS/DOR numbers reported in the abstract.\n- Evidence gap addressed: whether chemo induction increases initial response rates and potentially converts non‑responders to durable benefit.\n- Competitive implications: if PANDORA shows high ORR with acceptable DOR/tolerability, chemo‑IO may become considered for high‑burden or symptomatic patients — a potential niche threat to PD‑(L)1 monotherapy positioning.\n- How Medical Affairs can use it:\n  - At ESMO, probe inclusion/exclusion (e.g., viral status, brain mets, immunosuppression), detailed safety/grade ≥3 AE rates, choice of platinum, and any post‑induction response durability data.\n  - Use results to advise field on likely patient subsets where monotherapy remains preferred vs when chemo‑IO could be considered.\n\n1669P — Prognostic impact of organ‑specific metastasis on survival in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma\n- Abstract ID / Session: 1669P — Poster (Karam Khaddour). Poster session: 10/20/2025 12:00–13:00, Hall 25.\n- Key data from abstract:\n  - Cohort: n=687 metastatic MCC patients (126 with distant metastasis at diagnosis; 561 developed metastases later). 73% male; 22% immunosuppressed.\n  - Common metastatic sites: lymph nodes (50%), skin/subcutis (24%), bone (24%), liver (24%), lung (8%).\n  - Multivariable models: liver metastases (HR >1.8, p<0.001), bone (HR >1.7, p<0.001), pancreas (HR >1.9, p=0.001) independently associated with worse OS and DSS versus skin/subcut/lymph‑node‑only involvement.\n  - Proposed M‑stage incorporating count of “high‑risk” organs (liver/bone/pancreas); reported improved DSS prediction versus AJCC 8th M‑stage (c‑index quoted 0.56 vs 0.58, p=0.002; AIC 26.9) — abstract notes require careful review at full presentation.\n- Evidence gap addressed: organ‑site heterogeneity in prognosis and trial stratification logic.\n- Competitive implications: if adopted, trial designs (including adjuvant/perioperative trials) and clinical follow‑up strategies may shift to risk‑adapted approaches — affecting inclusion/exclusion and stratification in future studies.\n- How Medical Affairs can use it:\n  - Validate findings against multicenter/RWE datasets; discuss implications for ADAM stratification and for designing post‑progression trials focused on liver/bone metastasis.\n  - At ESMO, ask for methodological clarifications (model covariates, external validation plans) and availability of de‑identified datasets for independent validation.\n\n### Competitive Intelligence (ESMO 2025)\n- Highest immediate threat: LBA56 (STAMP — adjuvant pembrolizumab). Because it's a proffered LBA, its content may rapidly influence perioperative practice and payer expectations; watch subgroup analyses carefully.\n- Hypothesis‑generating threat: PANDORA. Early phase but could create a niche expectation for chemo‑IO in specific presentations (high tumor burden/symptoms).\n- Strategic opportunity: absence of prospective ctDNA/MRD‑guided interventional data at ESMO — a visible white space that could be leveraged for adjuvant differentiation (e.g., ctDNA‑directed ADAM substudies or new collaborations).\n- Other competitor signals (context from recent trials): retifanlimab ORR 54.5% in POD1UM‑201 (n=101) and nivolumab single‑agent durability (CheckMate 358 ORR ~60% with long DOR in a small cohort) increase class competition in 1L. Use these data to refine avelumab messaging on durability, safety and planned adjuvant positioning.\n\n### Evidence Gaps: What Will Be Addressed vs. What Remains\n- Addressed at ESMO:\n  - Potential confirmation (if STAMP is positive) that adjuvant PD‑1 reduces recurrence risk after resection — will be presented but abstract has no released numbers.\n  - Early operational data on chemo‑IO induction approach (PANDORA) — but no efficacy yet.\n  - Retrospective evidence that liver/bone/pancreas metastases confer worse survival and that an organ‑risk M‑stage may modestly improve prognostic discrimination.\n- Still unresolved after ESMO:\n  - Prospective MRD/ctDNA‑guided adjuvant therapy: no interventional trial data presented.\n  - Optimal second‑line strategies after frontline PD‑(L)1 failure remain unclear.\n  - Validated external confirmation of the new M‑stage and translation into trial eligibility or guideline changes.\n  - Robust data in immunosuppressed, elderly/frail, and CNS‑involved populations.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Considerations for Medical Affairs\n\nNote: the items below are strategic options and conversation starters rather than directives.\n\n### Ten Strategic Questions for KOL Engagement\n(Each question = context → ESMO abstract(s) informing → relation to avelumab)\n\n1. If STAMP reports a statistically and clinically meaningful DFS benefit, how would you position adjuvant PD‑1 therapy for MCPyV‑positive versus MCPyV‑negative tumors?  \n   - Context: LBA56; JAVELIN biomarker work shows biological differences by virus status (PMID: 39047170).  \n   - Avelumab relation: ADAM adjuvant program; ask about where avelumab could offer differentiation (safety, schedule, biomarker substudies).\n\n2. Would you adopt ctDNA (tumor‑informed) or MCPyV serology to select adjuvant therapy or to de‑escalate treatment? What performance (sensitivity/NPV) would make you comfortable?  \n   - Context: ESMO abstracts lacked MRD data; published tumor‑informed ctDNA sensitivity ≈94–95% and NPV ≈93–94% (PMID in background).  \n   - Avelumab relation: opportunity to integrate avelumab into MRD‑guided adjuvant strategies.\n\n3. For patients with high tumor burden or severe symptoms at presentation, does chemo induction plus PD‑(L)1 (PANDORA) change your frontline choice compared with PD‑(L)1 monotherapy? What durability threshold would be required?  \n   - Context: 1739eTiP; PANDORA is testing this exact question.  \n   - Avelumab relation: informs field messaging on when monotherapy remains preferred.\n\n4. How should presence of liver, bone, or pancreatic metastases influence systemic therapy selection, imaging frequency, and inclusion criteria for trials?  \n   - Context: 1669P proposes organ‑risk M‑stage.  \n   - Avelumab relation: trial stratification for ADAM/other programs and RWE analyses.\n\n5. What is an acceptable toxicity profile for adjuvant IO in MCC patients who may be cured by surgery alone? Which grade ≥3 AE rates would temper adoption?  \n   - Context: adjuvant setting tolerability is key; STAMP abstract release lacked safety numbers.  \n   - Avelumab relation: adjuvant safety may be a differentiation axis.\n\n6. For patients progressing on frontline PD‑(L)1, what second‑line strategies (chemo, CTLA‑4, ADCs) have you found most useful? What data would change that approach?  \n   - Context: CheckMate 358 and other IO sequencing data showed mixed results with CTLA‑4 addition and variable toxicity (PMID: 39889250).  \n   - Avelumab relation: informs potential post‑avelumab development opportunities.\n\n7. Would you support routine incorporation of organ‑risk (liver/bone/pancreas) into stratification for adjuvant trials? What validation would you need?  \n   - Context: 1669P proposes a new M‑stage with modest c‑index improvement.  \n   - Avelumab relation: could impact ADAM statistical planning or future adjuvant enrichment.\n\n8. In immunosuppressed patients, how do you balance risk of recurrence against potential immune‑related toxicity in the adjuvant setting? Would dedicated prospective cohorts be acceptable?  \n   - Context: ESMO abstracts included limited immunosuppressed representation (1669P ~22% immunosuppressed overall).  \n   - Avelumab relation: potential RWE or focused investigator trials to generate safety/efficacy data.\n\n9. What biomarkers (PD‑L1, TMB, MCPyV) meaningfully alter your treatment approach today, and what evidence would increase your reliance on one over another?  \n   - Context: JAVELIN biomarker analyses show differential biology by MCPyV/TMB (PMID: 39047170).  \n   - Avelumab relation: use to frame translational strategy and future correlative substudies.\n\n10. If you had access to a ctDNA MRD assay with the performance reported in the literature, would you enroll patients into an MRD‑guided adjuvant randomization (observational vs therapy) or treat all MRD‑positive patients?  \n    - Context: strong ctDNA surveillance performance in prospect studies (PMID: 39052958).  \n    - Avelumab relation: potential ADAM substudies or future sponsor‑led MRD trials.\n\n---\n\n### Ten High‑Value Discussion Topics (for KOLs / advisory boards / MSLs)\n(Each topic = 2–3 specific angles + supporting evidence + how avelumab fits)\n\n1. Adjuvant IO: STAMP vs ADAM — trial design crosswalk  \n   - Angles: endpoints (DFS vs OS), follow‑up duration, safety/discontinuation, subgroup (virus/immunosuppressed).  \n   - Evidence: LBA56 (no released numbers yet); ADAM ongoing; JAVELIN long‑term survival benchmarks.  \n   - Avelumab fit: discuss how ADAM design and correlative programs could be positioned relative to STAMP findings.\n\n2. MRD/ctDNA as an actionable biomarker in MCC  \n   - Angles: analytic performance, lead time to recurrence, impact on trial sensitivity and patient selection.  \n   - Evidence: tumor‑informed ctDNA sensitivity ~94–95%, NPV ~93–94% (prospective cohorts).  \n   - Avelumab fit: consider MRD‑guided adjuvant substudies, potential to avoid overtreatment.\n\n3. Chemo induction + PD‑(L)1 for high‑burden disease (PANDORA)  \n   - Angles: rapid cytoreduction vs long‑term durability, toxicity trade‑offs, patient selection.  \n   - Evidence: design & thresholds reported in 1739eTiP; comparator historical ORR/DOR for PD‑(L)1 monotherapy (pembrolizumab/retifanlimab).  \n   - Avelumab fit: discuss potential role of avelumab in combination regimens or as an alternative in patients unsuitable for chemo.\n\n4. Organ‑risk stratification and trial design  \n   - Angles: operationalizing liver/bone/pancreas risk, imaging schedules, endpoint selection.  \n   - Evidence: 1669P demonstrates independent adverse HRs for these sites.  \n   - Avelumab fit: adapt adjuvant eligibility/stratification or targeted RWE analyses.\n\n5. Biomarker biology: MCPyV, TMB and immune microenvironment  \n   - Angles: MCPyV+ tumors low TMB, differing immune cell patterns; predictive vs prognostic roles.  \n   - Evidence: JAVELIN Merkel biomarker analyses (exploratory).  \n   - Avelumab fit: tailor translational messaging and biomarker collection in ADAM.\n\n6. Safety and QOL in adjuvant settings  \n   - Angles: acceptable long‑term toxicity thresholds, monitoring strategies, survivorship impacts.  \n   - Evidence: limited safety data from STAMP abstract release; NIVO+IPI QOL analyses showed mixed results when RT added.  \n   - Avelumab fit: highlight tolerability data from avelumab cohorts and plan for long‑term safety follow‑up.\n\n7. Sequence of therapy after PD‑(L)1 failure  \n   - Angles: chemo, CTLA‑4, ADCs, clinical trials — when to choose each.  \n   - Evidence: CheckMate 358 combo signals higher toxicity without clear ORR advantage (PMID: 39889250); retifanlimab and other single‑agent PD‑1 data show meaningful ORR.  \n   - Avelumab fit: define potential investigator‑led or sponsor programs for post‑avelumab options.\n\n8. Special pops: immunosuppressed and elderly patients  \n   - Angles: treatment tolerance, recurrence risk, inclusion for adjuvant therapy.  \n   - Evidence: 1669P includes ~22% immunosuppressed but lacks controlled subgroup outcomes.  \n   - Avelumab fit: RWE collection opportunity for safety/effectiveness in these subgroups.\n\n9. Real‑world outcomes vs trial outcomes in MCC  \n   - Angles: differences in ORR/DOR/OS due to selection bias, performance status, comorbidity.  \n   - Evidence: small real‑world avelumab series (n=14 ORR 57%) supports trial effectiveness but sample sizes are small.  \n   - Avelumab fit: expand RWE program to provide robust comparator data.\n\n10. Health economic and payer perspectives for adjuvant IO  \n   - Angles: RFS vs OS acceptance, model inputs (recurrence rates, ctDNA‑guided de‑escalation), budget impact.  \n   - Evidence: STAMP LBA timing makes payer conversations urgent if positive.  \n   - Avelumab fit: prepare HEOR scenarios comparing adjuvant avelumab vs competitor PD‑1 and MRD‑guided approaches.\n\n---\n\n### Ten Objection Handling Frameworks\n(Format: scenario → Acknowledge → Context → Evidence → Differentiation → Suggested reframing)\n\n1. Scenario: “If STAMP is positive, why use adjuvant avelumab?”  \n   - Acknowledge: That’s a logical question if STAMP shows benefit.  \n   - Context: STAMP is a randomized Phase III; ADAM remains ongoing.  \n   - Evidence: Ask for STAMP’s DFS/OS, safety, and subgroup data; compare to ADAM inclusion criteria and JAVELIN long‑term outcomes.  \n   - Differentiation: Emphasize study design differences, correlative biomarker programs, and tolerability profiles that may influence choice.  \n   - Reframe: Discuss patient subgroups (virus status, comorbidity) where one agent may be preferred based on safety/biomarker data.\n\n2. Scenario: “Chemo+IO (PANDORA) will become the new frontline standard.”  \n   - Acknowledge: High ORR is attractive for symptomatic patients.  \n   - Context: PANDORA is a small single‑arm Phase II with provisional enrollment (13/35 as of Apr 2025).  \n   - Evidence: Durable benefit and acceptable toxicity need confirmation vs historical PD‑(L)1 monotherapy durability (e.g., pembrolizumab/avelumab trials).  \n   - Differentiation: avelumab’s efficacy durability and ongoing adjuvant program remain strengths; chemo toxicity must be balanced against long‑term outcomes.  \n   - Reframe: Consider chemo‑IO for specific high‑burden scenarios while maintaining PD‑(L)1 monotherapy as standard for many patients until confirmatory data exist.\n\n3. Scenario: “The organ‑risk M‑stage is not useful — c‑index is low.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Reported discrimination appears modest.  \n   - Context: 1669P reports c‑index values (0.56 vs 0.58) and statistical improvement (p=0.002) but needs external validation.  \n   - Evidence: Ask for calibration metrics, external datasets, and subgroup performance.  \n   - Differentiation: Suggest the proposition is hypothesis‑generating and could improve trial stratification after validation.  \n   - Reframe: Propose multicenter validation to determine operational usefulness.\n\n4. Scenario: “Biomarkers (PD‑L1/TMB) don’t guide therapy in MCC.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Prediction is imperfect, especially in virus‑positive tumors.  \n   - Context: JAVELIN analyses show MCPyV+ tumors are biologically distinct (low TMB, different immune infiltration patterns).  \n   - Evidence: Present exploratory biomarker signals that inform biology even if not strongly predictive today.  \n   - Differentiation: Use avelumab translational data to support tailored correlative plans rather than broad biomarker exclusion.  \n   - Reframe: Focus on integrated biomarker panels (MCPyV + ctDNA + immune markers).\n\n5. Scenario: “Adding CTLA‑4 increases toxicity without clear benefit.”  \n   - Acknowledge: This is supported by some datasets.  \n   - Context: CheckMate 358 nonrandomized cohorts suggested higher grade ≥3 TRAEs with NIVO+IPI without clear ORR upside.  \n   - Evidence: Cite toxicity rates and survival signals; emphasize selective use only in trials or defined subgroups.  \n   - Differentiation: avelumab combos should be tested with clear benefit hypotheses and biomarker enrichment.  \n   - Reframe: Prioritize combinations with strong mechanistic rationale and manageable toxicity.\n\n6. Scenario: “ctDNA isn’t ready for clinical decisions.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Laboratory variability and clinical validation remain concerns.  \n   - Context: Tumor‑informed ctDNA studies show high sensitivity (~94–95%) and strong NPV, but prospective interventional trials are limited.  \n   - Evidence: Use published sensitivity/NPV/PPV numbers and discuss lead time to recurrence.  \n   - Differentiation: Advocate MRD‑guided prospective trials rather than routine adoption today.  \n   - Reframe: Propose ctDNA as a stratification/enrichment biomarker for adjuvant trials.\n\n7. Scenario: “Adjuvant IO will overtreat many cured patients.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Risk of overtreatment is real.  \n   - Context: Adjuvant treatment benefit needs to be balanced against toxicity in patients who may be cured by surgery alone.  \n   - Evidence: Emphasize need for risk stratification (stage, ctDNA, MCPyV) to target therapy.  \n   - Differentiation: Suggest MRD or high‑risk organ involvement as potential enrichment strategies.  \n   - Reframe: Use targeted adjuvant therapy for MRD+ or high‑risk patients rather than all comers.\n\n8. Scenario: “We don’t have safety data in elderly/frail patients.”  \n   - Acknowledge: That’s a common gap in oncology.  \n   - Context: Many trials underrepresent ECOG ≥2 or frail patients.  \n   - Evidence: Present RWE and small series where available (real‑world avelumab n=14 ORR 57% as supportive but limited).  \n   - Differentiation: Recommend RWE collection and targeted prospective cohorts to fill the knowledge gap.  \n   - Reframe: Use real‑world data to inform individualized decision making.\n\n9. Scenario: “Payers will require OS benefit for adjuvant coverage.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Some payers prioritize OS, others accept DFS/RFS depending on context.  \n   - Context: Oncology precedent exists for DFS‑based approvals; economic modeling can show value through avoided recurrences and cost offsets.  \n   - Evidence: Prepare HEOR scenarios comparing adjuvant IO vs surgery alone and MRD‑guided strategies.  \n   - Differentiation: avelumab’s long‑term durability data and potential MRD pairing may strengthen cost‑effectiveness arguments.  \n   - Reframe: Model short‑term and long‑term economic outcomes for payers.\n\n10. Scenario: “Avelumab lacks head‑to‑head data against newer PD‑1 agents.”  \n    - Acknowledge: True — head‑to‑head trials are rare.  \n    - Context: Cross‑trial comparisons are imperfect; focus on patient‑centric endpoints and subgroups.  \n    - Evidence: Use JAVELIN long‑term survival metrics and safety profiles for contextual comparison.  \n    - Differentiation: Highlight unique translational programs (MCPyV, ADCC biology) and planned adjuvant activities.  \n    - Reframe: Emphasize practical comparisons (schedule, safety, biomarker programs) rather than untestable superiority claims.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence Generation Priorities\n\nImmediate priorities (high strategic value, low resource requirement)\n- Rapid internal STAMP watch: immediate scientific readout within 24–48 hours of LBA presentation; create a scientific crosswalk versus ADAM (design, endpoints, inclusion/exclusion, key subgroups).  \n- Post‑hoc/pooled analyses: re‑examine JAVELIN datasets for organ‑site outcomes (liver, bone, pancreas) to see whether avelumab outcomes differ by site — quick RWE queries across clinical centers.  \n- Field materials: prepare MSL Q&A and slide pack summarizing STAMP vs ADAM scenarios and potential MRD implications (non‑promotional, evidence only).  \n- Rapid literature synthesis: short white paper summarizing ctDNA performance characteristics and design options for MRD‑guided adjuvant trials.\n\nMedium‑term opportunities (6–18 months, moderate investment)\n- External validation of 1669P M‑stage: partner with multi‑institutional consortia / RWE vendors to test the organ‑risk M‑stage in independent datasets and quantify impact on trial stratification and prognosis.  \n- MRD‑guided adjuvant substudies: consider embedding prospective tumor‑informed ctDNA collection and predefined MRD‑analysis plans into ADAM (or investigator‑led collaborations) to generate interventional evidence in 6–18 months.  \n- Focused RWE cohorts: build datasets for immunosuppressed, elderly/frail, and organ‑specific metastasis patients treated with avelumab to inform safety/efficacy in underrepresented populations.\n\nLonger‑term considerations (major investment, strategic only)\n- Prospective randomized MRD‑guided adjuvant trial (MRD+ randomization to adjuvant IO vs observation) — high scientific value but resource intensive; consider only after feasibility/biomarker performance is confirmed.  \n- Sponsor‑led combination programs targeted to high‑risk organ sites (e.g., liver‑directed therapy + IO) if validation shows organ‑specific differential benefit; require mechanistic rationale and biomarker support.  \n- Development partnerships with diagnostics companies to co‑develop a companion MRD assay for trial/in‑label claims — strategic but resource heavy.\n\n---\n\n### At ESMO: Priority Engagement\n- Must‑attend session: LBA56 (Janice M. Mehnert) — 10/20/2025 09:30–09:40, Cologne Auditorium. Priorities: obtain slides, ask about subgroups (MCPyV, immunosuppressed), ctDNA use, and safety details (grade ≥3 AEs, discontinuations).\n- Poster hour (12:00–13:00, Hall 25): visit 1669P (Karam Khaddour) and 1739eTiP (Simone Oldani). Priorities:\n  - For Khaddour: query methods for proposed M‑stage, plans for external validation, and whether they will share de‑identified data or code.\n  - For Oldani: obtain enrollment updates, early safety signals, platinum choice (carboplatin vs cisplatin), criteria for response assessment, and biomarker collection plans.\n- KOLs to prioritize for one‑on‑one scientific discussions: Janice Mehnert (adjuvant strategy), Karam Khaddour (prognostic staging), Simone Oldani (chemo‑IO rationale and safety). Use non‑promotional scientific exchange.\n\n### Post‑ESMO: Communication and Dissemination (suggestive timing)\n- Within 24–48 hours after LBA: internal rapid brief to commercial, medical, regulatory and HEOR teams summarizing the STAMP headline and gaps (safety, subgroups).  \n- Within 1 week: updated MSL talking points (non‑promotional) with comparative design table (STAMP vs ADAM) and prioritized KOL questions.  \n- Within 1 month: plan advisory or moderated KOL forum to interpret implications for adjuvant strategy and MRD priorities (framed as a strategic discussion, not a directive).\n\n---\n\n## Leadership Considerations\n\n### Competitive Monitoring: triggers and suggested responses\n- If STAMP shows significant DFS/OS benefit with acceptable safety → leadership may want to consider rapid HEOR re‑scoping, payer scenario planning, and prioritizing ADAM biomarker readouts to enable differentiation.  \n- If PANDORA shows high ORR and durable responses in high‑burden patients → leadership may want to monitor for confirmatory efforts or consider investigator partnerships to evaluate avelumab‑containing chemo‑IO regimens only if mechanistic rationale supports benefit.  \n- If 1669P M‑stage is validated externally and adopted by guideline committees → leadership may want to consider re‑stratifying development and RWE cohorts to reflect organ‑risk categories and prioritize studies targeting high‑risk organs.\n\n### Strategic Investment Areas (considerations, not directives)\n- Diagnostics partnership(s): investing or collaborating on a tumor‑informed ctDNA MRD assay could materially strengthen adjuvant positioning and create differentiation opportunities.  \n- RWE scale‑up: invest in multicenter RWE to validate organ‑risk staging and to characterize avelumab outcomes in immunosuppressed and frail populations.  \n- Translational biology: support mechanistic work on MCPyV biology and Fc‑mediated effects to inform combination strategies with macrophage‑modulating agents or ADCs if biologic rationale emerges.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\nKey Abstracts (ESMO 2025)\n- LBA56 — ECOG‑ACRIN EA6174: STAMP — Surgically Treated Adjuvant Merkel Cell Carcinoma with Pembrolizumab, Phase III (Proffered paper; full efficacy/safety not released in abstract). Strategic relevance: possible practice‑changing adjuvant readout; direct competitor to ADAM.\n- 1739eTiP — PANDORA: Phase II pembrolizumab + platinum/etoposide in 1L advanced MCC (Simon two‑stage; planned N=35; 13 enrolled as of Apr 2025). Strategic relevance: tests chemo‑induction paradigm for high‑burden disease.\n- 1669P — Prognostic impact of organ‑specific metastasis in MCC (n=687). Strategic relevance: proposes an organ‑risk M‑stage (liver/bone/pancreas high risk) with modest predictive improvement vs AJCC.\n\nPriority KOLs\n- Janice M. Mehnert — Perlmutter Cancer Center (NYU Langone). Expertise: adjuvant PD‑1 strategies (STAMP presenter) and previous avelumab/JAVELIN involvement. LBA56 presenter (10/20/2025 09:30).\n- Karam Khaddour — Dana‑Farber Cancer Institute. Expertise: metastatic patterns, prognostic modeling (1669P poster, 10/20/2025 12:00).\n- Simone Oldani — European Institute of Oncology, Milan. Expertise: chemo‑immunotherapy trial design (PANDORA ePoster, 10/20/2025 12:00).\n\n---\n\nBased on ESMO 2025 abstracts, the immediate tactical focus for Medical Affairs may want to be: (1) attend LBA56 and obtain granular subgroup/safety data; (2) validate 1669P's organ‑risk findings with external datasets; (3) probe PANDORA for safety/durability and biomarker collection; and (4) accelerate discussion with diagnostics partners on MRD strategies that could add scientific differentiation to the avelumab adjuvant program. These are strategic options to inform field engagement, evidence generation planning, and leadership monitoring — to be adapted to local regulatory and commercial contexts After ESMO."

    "analysis": "# Strategic Briefing: Head and Neck Cancer — ESMO 2025 (Pre‑conference)\n\n*Pre‑conference briefing based on ESMO 2025 abstracts. Date: 14 Oct 2025 — ESMO runs 17–21 Oct 2025.*\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nCetuximab (Erbitux) enters ESMO 2025 still anchored in two clear clinical niches: (1) 1L recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC for PD‑L1–negative or IO‑ineligible patients per the EXTREME backbone, and (2) radiosensitizer for cisplatin‑ineligible locally advanced (LA) HNSCC. However, pembrolizumab‑based regimens (KEYNOTE‑048 paradigm) and the recent perioperative pembrolizumab approval (KEYNOTE‑689; June 2025) have shifted much of the 1L and curative‑intent momentum toward PD‑1 agents. New ADCs/bispecifics and perioperative IO programs are the largest near‑term threats.\n\nBased on ESMO 2025 abstracts, the items most likely to change the competitive picture are: (a) late‑breaking ADC/bispecific data in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LBA35 BL‑B01D1 — Iza‑Bren) and other EGFR/EGFR‑HER3 ADCs (potential to erode EGFR antibody utility in NPC and R/M HNC), (b) late‑breaking post‑IO options data (LBA48 BURAN: buparlisib + paclitaxel in PD‑1 pretreated R/M HNSCC — LBA status signals potential practice influence), (c) mixed results from innate/myeloid immune add‑ons to PD‑1 (SKYSCRAPER‑09 tiragolumab + atezolizumab — modest ORR/PFS with safety signals; ASPEN‑03 evorpacept + pembrolizumab — modest ORR), and (d) robust MRD/ctDNA prognostic data in HPV+ OPSCC (TTMV‑HPV) that advance surveillance/stratification. Each of these axes affects how clinicians choose IO vs non‑IO options and which populations remain dependent on cetuximab.\n\nTop strategic priorities for Medical Affairs during and after ESMO: (1) rapid field education (MSL one‑pagers and FAQs) on safety/efficacy signals from SKYSCRAPER‑09/ASPEN‑03 and on the late‑breaking ADC/BUran data as they appear; (2) accelerate RWE generation/dissemination in PD‑L1–negative and cisplatin‑ineligible populations to defend the EXTREME and cetuximab+RT niches; (3) engage KOLs on MRD utility and implications for perioperative/ surveillance pathways; and (4) put an executive watch on LBA outcomes (Iza‑Bren, BURAN) with predefined monitoring triggers for regulatory/guideline impact.\n\n---\n\n## Pre‑ESMO 2025 Head and Neck Cancer Landscape\n\n### Current Treatment Paradigm\n- First‑line R/M HNSCC: pembrolizumab‑based regimens are the dominant standard (KEYNOTE‑048‑derived practice): pembrolizumab + platinum/5‑FU for CPS ≥1 and pembrolizumab monotherapy for CPS ≥20. Cetuximab + platinum/5‑FU (EXTREME) remains the recognized option for PD‑L1 <1 or patients ineligible for IO.  \n- Second‑line: nivolumab and other anti‑PD‑1 agents are established after platinum. Cetuximab retains later‑line utility for some patients.  \n- Locally advanced (curative): concurrent cisplatin + RT is the standard for fit patients; cetuximab + RT remains the alternative for cisplatin‑ineligible patients (radiosensitizer role). Perioperative pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE‑689) is now an approved curative‑intent option (June 2025) and is shifting neoadjuvant/adjuvant paradigms.  \n- Diagnostics: PD‑L1 CPS (22C3/other assays) is the main clinical classifier; however assay concordance and supplemental immune/transcriptional signatures are evolving. ctDNA/MRD (e.g., TTMV‑HPV) is emerging rapidly as a prognostic surveillance tool.\n\n### How Cetuximab (Erbitux) currently compares\n- Strengths\n  - Long clinical history and guideline presence (EXTREME regimen; radiosensitizer for cisplatin‑ineligible LA disease).\n  - Rapid cytoreduction and radiosensitization properties valued in selected patients and multidisciplinary settings.\n  - Clear positioning for PD‑L1 negative or IO‑ineligible patients — a practical “non‑IO” pathway when pembrolizumab is contraindicated or unavailable.\n- Weaknesses / Pressure points\n  - IO durability advantage in PD‑L1 positive populations and expanding perioperative IO indications reduce the eligible population for cetuximab‑based regimens.\n  - New targeted modalities (ADCs, bispecifics, novel IO combinations) are advancing in R/M and NPC with potential to outcompete EGFR‑directed antibodies depending on confirmatory outcomes.\n  - Biomarker evolution (PD‑L1 nuances, transcriptomic/spatial signatures, ctDNA MRD) may narrow cetuximab’s use to smaller, well‑defined subgroups.\n- Market dynamics: Stable but pressured — cetuximab retains essential niches; however maintaining access/reimbursement requires proactive RWE, outcome messaging in PD‑L1 negative and cisplatin‑ineligible populations, and field readiness to discuss new entrants.\n\n### Evidence Gaps and Unmet Needs\n- Robust prospective data guiding sequencing after anti‑PD‑1 failure remain limited — multiple abstracts flagged post‑progression strategies at ESMO but no consensus sequence.  \n- Interventional MRD‑guided management trials in HNC are sparse despite strong prognostic MRD signals (TTMV‑HPV).  \n- Validated transcriptomic or spatial immune biomarkers for routine clinical selection are not widely adoptable yet.  \n- Frail/elderly and ECOG ≥2 patient populations are underrepresented in trials; practical data for radiosensitizer vs alternative strategies are needed.  \n- Safety of multi‑agent immune co‑blockade (e.g., TIGIT, myeloid blockers) in HNC requires further clarity after mixed signals at ESMO.\n\n---\n\n## What's Being Presented at ESMO 2025 in Head and Neck Cancer\n\nBelow are the highest‑priority abstracts (by expected clinical/market impact) that Medical Affairs and MSLs should track. For regular abstracts I report the data listed in the abstracts; for LBA items I note that full data will be presented At ESMO and flag what to watch.\n\n### High‑Priority Studies (data from abstracts)\n\n1. 1348MO — SKYSCRAPER‑09: tiragolumab (anti‑TIGIT) + atezolizumab vs atezolizumab + placebo in 1L PD‑L1+ R/M SCCHN  \n   - Key data from abstract: ORR 21.3% (tira+atezo) vs 15.4% (atezo+pbo); median PFS 4.1 vs 3.0 months; median OS 16.2 vs 13.6 months. In PD‑L1–high subgroup (TAP ≥20%) mOS 22.7 vs 10.0 months favoring tiragolumab. Grade 5 AEs higher on the tiragolumab arm (10% vs 2.6%); abstract states none were treatment‑related per investigator assessment.  \n   - Evidence gap addressed: role of TIGIT blockade added to PD‑L1 therapy in PD‑L1 selected HNSCC; PD‑L1 stratification effects.  \n   - Competitive implication: demonstrates heterogeneous benefit from co‑inhibitor additions; safety signal complicates adoption. Could slow adoption of broad anti‑TIGIT combos and emphasize biomarker‑tailored approaches.  \n   - MA use: prepare safety FAQ and help HCPs interpret PD‑L1 stratification; probe subgroup credibility with KOLs.\n\n2. 1323MO — ASPEN‑03: evorpacept (CD47 blocker) + pembrolizumab vs pembrolizumab in PD‑L1+ R/M HNSCC  \n   - Key data from abstract: Confirmed ORR evorpacept+pembro 26.4% (95% CI 18.8–35.2) vs pembrolizumab 18.3% (95% CI 9.5–30.4). Abstract reports modest ORR increase; did not meet robust statistical threshold vs historical benchmark in this dataset. Safety consistent with prior experience.  \n   - Evidence gap addressed: Can innate/myeloid checkpoint blockade augment PD‑1 in PD‑L1+ disease?  \n   - Competitive implication: Modest efficacy signal — could encourage further translational work but not immediate displacement of current standards. Watch durability (DOR/PFS/OS) and correlative biomarkers.  \n   - MA use: prepare balanced talking points for KOL conversations; track translational correlates.\n\n3. 1320O — ADRISK: Adjuvant cisplatin‑RT ± pembrolizumab in resected high/intermediate‑risk HNSCC (adjuvant setting)  \n   - Key data from abstract: Randomized Phase IIb; planned N=240 but 204 treated. After median 30 months, pembrolizumab arm showed numerical EFS improvement (HR 0.81) and OS trend (HR 0.85) but neither statistically significant (underpowered). Subgroup suggestion of benefit in HPV‑unrelated and CPS <10 cohorts. No new safety signals reported.  \n   - Evidence gap addressed: whether adding PD‑1 to adjuvant cisplatin‑RT improves outcomes post‑resection.  \n   - Competitive implication: Underpowered negative/neutral signal — not practice changing but hypothesis generating for HPV‑negative/CPS low subgroups. Useful in advising clinicians about adjuvant IO uncertainties.  \n   - MA use: support field discussions on subgroup data; caution against broad adjuvant IO adoption based on this dataset.\n\n4. 1366P — TTMV‑HPV ctDNA clearance and outcomes in HPV+ OPSCC (MRD surveillance)  \n   - Key data from abstract: Retrospective cohort n=88; post‑treatment MRD positive n=11. MRD+ associated with worse PFS: 1‑yr PFS 45% vs 93%; 2‑yr PFS 11% vs 84%; multivariable PFS HR 4.43 (p=0.017). MRD+ correlated with worse OS at 1–2 years.  \n   - Evidence gap addressed: prognostic value of tumor‑modified HPV ctDNA as MRD after definitive therapy.  \n   - Competitive implication: strengthens case for ctDNA in surveillance and for MRD‑guided escalation/de‑escalation trials — may alter perioperative/adjuvant decision‑making where cetuximab is used as alternative in some curative pathways.  \n   - MA use: engage molecular diagnostics and surgical/radiation KOLs on implications; consider diagnostic partnerships or RWE protocols.\n\n5. 1337P — JCOG1212 RADPLAT: superselective intra‑arterial cisplatin + RT for T4b maxillary sinus SCC (T4b cohort)  \n   - Key data from abstract: n=64; 3‑yr OS 68.8% (90% CI 58.1–77.2%), surpassing historical IV‑CRT threshold (20%); 3‑yr EFS 51.6%; CR rate 54.7% (35/64). Grade 3 neutropenia 18.9%, grade 3 mucositis 18.0%; no treatment‑related deaths.  \n   - Evidence gap addressed: achieving locoregional control in anatomically difficult maxillary sinus T4b disease.  \n   - Competitive implication: regional practice impact for a hard‑to‑treat subgroup; not directly competing with cetuximab in broader HNSCC but alters local treatment choices and referral patterns.  \n   - MA use: identify centers with RADPLAT capability for scientific exchange and potential investigator collaborations.\n\n6. 1371P — PLATINUM (NPC): nivolumab + chemoradiotherapy perioperative PROs and QoL  \n   - Key data from abstract: PROs show QoL declines during induction→RT and improvement afterwards; RT is main driver of short‑term QoL deterioration; overall tolerability acceptable.  \n   - Evidence gap addressed: patient‑reported outcomes for chemo‑sparing or chemo‑substituting approaches combining IO with RT.  \n   - Competitive implication: supports feasibility of IO‑centric perioperative strategies and informs patient counseling on QoL tradeoffs versus traditional regimens (relevant to cetuximab radiosensitization niche).  \n   - MA use: prepare QoL discussion guides for surgeons and radiation oncologists.\n\n7. LBA48 — BURAN: buparlisib + paclitaxel in PD‑1 pretreated R/M HNSCC (Phase III, Late‑Breaking)  \n   - Data status: LBA (late breaking) — full abstract to be presented At ESMO. Trial compares buparlisib + paclitaxel vs paclitaxel alone in PD‑1 pretreated patients. Key endpoints expected: OS and PFS; poster/slide set at LBA.  \n   - What to watch: magnitude of OS/PFS benefit, safety profile (PI3K class toxicities), biomarker signals (PI3K pathway alterations), subgroup results in PI3K‑altered tumors.  \n   - Competitive implication: positive result would change post‑IO standard options and directly impact cetuximab’s later‑line use; negative/null would reduce PI3K inhibitor enthusiasm.  \n   - MA use: prioritize attendance at the LBA and prepare rapid‑response materials depending on outcome.\n\n8. LBA35 — Iza‑Bren (BL‑B01D1) EGFR×HER3 ADC vs physician’s choice in heavily pretreated R/M nasopharyngeal carcinoma  \n   - Data status: Late‑breaking abstract (Huaqiang Zhou presenting). Full efficacy/safety data expected At ESMO.  \n   - What to watch: ORR, duration of response, PFS/OS, key toxicities (on‑target EGFR/skin, HER3 off‑target), and comparator performance.  \n   - Competitive implication: positive ADC LBA in NPC would be practice‑changing for NPC and signal that ADCs can displace EGFR mAbs in EGFR‑expressing disease subsets. This directly threatens cetuximab’s EGFR utility in NPC subsets and may accelerate ADC adoption in other HNCs.  \n   - MA use: make LBA attendance a priority and prepare comparative scientific materials for HCP discussions.\n\n9. 1415P — PD‑L1 assay concordance (SP263 vs 22C3) and correlation with TIGIT/CD155 (PVR)  \n   - Key data: abstract examines SP263/22C3 agreement and associations with TIGIT/CD155 expression. (Poster session 10/20)  \n   - Evidence gap addressed: how assay choice may change who is PD‑L1 positive and therefore pembrolizumab‑eligible — relevant for cetuximab positioning in PD‑L1‑negative patients.  \n   - MA use: equip MSLs to discuss assay variability and implications for treatment selection.\n\n10. Other notable early‑phase/perioperative items to watch at ESMO: toripalimab + NAC for organ preservation (1339P), transcriptomic/niche immune signature validations tied to nivolumab outcomes (1403P), and additional ADC/bispecific first‑in‑human updates (various mini‑oral/poster sessions). These inform organ‑preservation choices and biomarker evolution.\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Intelligence — what matters to Erbitux\n\n- Perioperative IO (durvalumab, pembrolizumab, toripalimab): Moderate‑High threat. As perioperative anti‑PD‑1/PD‑L1 evidence accumulates (including HRQoL and long‑term durability), the use of cetuximab as a non‑IO radiosensitizer or chemotherapy alternative in curative pathways could shrink. CompARE (Mehanna, 1317O) and other perioperative proffereds should be watched closely.  \n- ADCs/bispecifics (Iza‑Bren LBA35; petosemtamab ongoing phase 3): High threat in NPC and potentially broader R/M histologies. A positive LBA (Iza‑Bren) will accelerate ADC uptake and reduce EGFR mAb relevance where ADCs show superior ORR/DOR.  \n- Post‑IO targeted agents (BURAN LBA48): High surveillance priority. If buparlisib + paclitaxel improves OS in PD‑1‑pretreated patients, the post‑IO landscape changes — influencing second‑line cetuximab use.  \n- Innate/myeloid co‑modulators (evorpacept, others) and TIGIT: Mixed results at ESMO — modest activity (ASPEN‑03) vs safety concerns (SKYSCRAPER‑09). These data emphasize that not all PD‑1 add‑ons are beneficial and that biomarker selection will be critical. This is an opportunity to highlight cetuximab’s known safety/manageability profile in appropriate patients.  \n- Diagnostics: Stronger MRD/ctDNA prognostic evidence (TTMV‑HPV) will prompt clinicians to adopt MRD surveillance; this could change adjuvant/perioperative decision algorithms and the size/nature of the cetuximab‑eligible population.\n\nThreat level summary: ADCs/bispecifics + LBA post‑IO data = High; perioperative IO expansion = Moderate‑High; TIGIT/myeloid add‑ons = Mixed (depends on subgroup/safety); assay/biomarker evolution = strategic (could narrow or better define cetuximab’s niche).\n\n---\n\n## Evidence Gaps: What ESMO 2025 will address vs what will remain\n\nWill be addressed (partially)\n- Prognostic value of ctDNA MRD after definitive therapy (TTMV‑HPV) — ESMO provides strong prognostic retrospective data; clinical utility (interventional MRD‑guided escalation) still immature.  \n- Short‑term HRQoL and feasibility of adding IO to perioperative regimens (NIAGARA/PLATINUM PROs) — ESMO adds PRO context though survival follow‑up is needed.  \n- Activity/toxicity signals for innate/myeloid add‑ons and TIGIT in PD‑L1 selected HNSCC — ESMO offers randomized Phase II signals and safety flags.\n\nWill likely remain open after ESMO\n- Definitive sequencing algorithms after frontline anti‑PD‑1 failure — LBA(s) may shift options, but consensus sequencing will need confirmatory/real‑world datasets.  \n- Prospective MRD‑driven interventional evidence changing standard practice — prognostic datasets are maturing, but randomized MRD‑guided trials are still required.  \n- Robust, standardized transcriptomic/spatial biomarker assays for routine patient selection — validation across trials is ongoing; not solved at ESMO.  \n- Large‑scale trials showing survival advantage for many novel combinations — many are early‑phase or underpowered; confirmatory Phase III data will lag.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Considerations for Medical Affairs\n\nBelow are practical, field‑usable strategic tools (questions, discussion topics, objection frameworks) designed for MSLs, medical leads and leadership to use At ESMO and After ESMO.\n\n### Ten Strategic Questions for KOL Engagement\n(Use to guide advisory boards, targeted KOL discussions; each shows why it matters and which ESMO abstract informs it.)\n\n1. How are you currently deciding between pembrolizumab‑based therapy and an EXTREME/cetuximab pathway for patients with CPS <1 or borderline CPS results?  \n   - Why it matters: Protects cetuximab positioning in PD‑L1 negative cases.  \n   - Relevant ESMO abstracts: 1415P (PD‑L1 assay concordance), SKYSCRAPER‑09 (1348MO).  \n   - Cetuximab relevance: clarifies local testing thresholds and real‑world decision drivers.\n\n2. For cisplatin‑ineligible LA patients, how do you weigh cetuximab+RT vs perioperative IO options or alternative RT strategies?  \n   - Why: perioperative IO momentum (KEYNOTE‑689 approval) could shift standards.  \n   - ESMO prompts: PLATINUM PROs (1371P), CompARE proffered (1317O).  \n   - Cetuximab relevance: defend radiosensitizer use and patient selection.\n\n3. Does the TTMV‑HPV MRD signal change how you plan surveillance or adjuvant escalation for HPV+ OPSCC? What prospective data would change practice?  \n   - Why: MRD offers lead time to recurrence detection.  \n   - ESMO prompt: 1366P.  \n   - Cetuximab relevance: MRD may change the frequency and timing of systemic treatment decisions.\n\n4. Given SKYSCRAPER‑09 (1348MO) and ASPEN‑03 (1323MO), how do you view adding non‑PD‑1 immune modifiers to PD‑1/L1 backbones in HNSCC? Which biomarkers should guide those choices?  \n   - Why: Clarifies appetite for combinations and tolerability thresholds.  \n   - Cetuximab relevance: potential to emphasize safety/known management for cetuximab in certain patients.\n\n5. If the ADC LBA (Iza‑Bren LBA35) shows superior ORR/DOR in NPC, how would that change your use of EGFR mAbs in NPC and R/M HNSCC?  \n   - Why: Direct competitive threat to EGFR antibody utility.  \n   - ESMO prompt: LBA35.  \n   - Cetuximab relevance: anticipate formulary and guideline inquiries.\n\n6. What data would convince you to use a PI3K inhibitor combination after PD‑1 progression (e.g., BUran)? Which biomarkers matter?  \n   - Why: Post‑IO sequencing is a major unmet need.  \n   - ESMO prompt: LBA48 BURAN.  \n   - Cetuximab relevance: potential displacement in later lines.\n\n7. For elderly or frail patients, which endpoints (QoL, organ function, hospitalization) most influence your preference for cetuximab+RT vs alternative approaches?  \n   - Why: Evidence gap in frail populations.  \n   - ESMO prompt: 1371P PROs, 1336P elderly RT trends.  \n   - Cetuximab relevance: defend cisplatin alternative role.\n\n8. How do you interpret PD‑L1 assay discordance (22C3 vs SP263) in borderline patients — does this alter the availability of pembrolizumab or push toward cetuximab?  \n   - Why: Practical test‑to‑treatment pathway question.  \n   - ESMO prompt: 1415P.  \n   - Cetuximab relevance: informs payer/coverage discussions.\n\n9. In patients with rapid symptomatic burden requiring quick control, how do you choose between cetuximab combinations versus IO approaches? What factors (response speed, durability, safety) matter most?  \n   - Why: Cetuximab’s rapid cytoreduction is clinically relevant.  \n   - ESMO prompt: early‑phase chemo‑immunotherapy signals (various posters).  \n   - Cetuximab relevance: highlight speed vs durability tradeoffs.\n\n10. Which biomarkers beyond PD‑L1 (transcriptomic, spatial, ctDNA) will you accept to guide first‑line and perioperative therapy selection in the next 12–24 months?  \n    - Why: Planning for diagnostic partnerships and lab support.  \n    - ESMO prompts: 1403P (transcriptomic signatures), 1366P (ctDNA).  \n    - Cetuximab relevance: impacts patient selection and market access.\n\n---\n\n### Ten High‑Value Discussion Topics (for MSL/KOL exchanges)\n(Each topic includes 2–3 practical discussion angles and how cetuximab fits)\n\n1.

cross‑tumor extrapolation requires caution.  \n   - Evidence: LBA outcomes will clarify ORR/DOR vs meaningful OS benefit.  \n   - Differentiate: Cetuximab has extensive real‑world experience, clear toxicity management, and immediate availability.  \n   - Takeaway: Monitor LBA results; discuss ADCs as additional options rather than immediate full displacement until confirmatory data/guidelines change.\n\n3. “Why not give IO + everything (TIGIT/CD47 etc.)?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Adding immune agents is appealing to overcome resistance.  \n   - Context: ESMO shows heterogeneous efficacy and safety (SKYSCRAPER‑09, ASPEN‑03).  \n   - Evidence: modest ORR gains vs safety tradeoffs and subgroup dependence.  \n   - Differentiate: Emphasize need for predictive biomarkers before broad combinations.  \n   - Takeaway: Encourage enrollment in biomarker‑guided trials.\n\n4. “Is MRD actionable today?”  \n   - Acknowledge: MRD has strong prognostic signal (TTMV‑HPV).  \n   - Context: Interventional data are limited — prognostic ≠ proven benefit from MRD‑guided therapy.  \n   - Evidence: TTMV‑HPV MRD+ patients had much worse PFS (HR 4.43).  \n   - Differentiate: Use MRD for heightened surveillance and trial selection, not yet for routine automatic escalation.  \n   - Takeaway: Consider MRD for risk stratification and trial enrollment.\n\n5. “SKYSCRAPER shows OS gain in PD‑L1‑high — should we adopt anti‑TIGIT?”  \n   - Acknowledge: PD‑L1‑high subgroup signal exists (mOS 22.7 vs 10.0 months).  \n   - Context: Overall PFS benefit was limited and fatal AE rate higher in the combo arm.  \n   - Evidence: Risk/benefit depends on reproducibility and toxicity attribution.  \n   - Differentiate: Recommend cautious interpretation until confirmatory data and toxicity adjudication are available.  \n   - Takeaway: Await follow‑up mechanistic and safety analyses.\n\n6. “Post‑IO, we have no good options — why is cetuximab relevant?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Post‑IO sequencing is an unmet need; new agents are in development (BURAN).  \n   - Context: Cetuximab retains activity in some later lines and is familiar to clinicians.  \n   - Evidence: Cetuximab monotherapy/combination data in later lines remain part of the armamentarium.  \n   - Differentiate: Use cetuximab where biology, prior therapy and comorbidity favor a non‑IO approach while awaiting new post‑IO data.  \n   - Takeaway: Cetuximab can be a practical option pending confirmatory post‑IO agents.\n\n7. “Is cetuximab tolerable in the elderly?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Toxicity concerns are valid in frail patients.  \n   - Context: Radiation and systemic chemo drive QoL declines; cetuximab+RT may be better tolerated than cisplatin in some patients.  \n   - Evidence: PRO data (PLATINUM) highlight RT as a major QoL driver; institutional series support cetuximab use in cisplatin‑ineligible.  \n   - Differentiate: Tailor approach using geriatric assessment and multi‑disciplinary input.  \n   - Takeaway: Cetuximab remains an option in selected elderly/frail patients.\n\n8. “PD‑L1 assay differences mean different therapy choices — how do we counsel?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Assay discordance exists (22C3 vs SP263).  \n   - Context: Borderline CPS results are common and actionable decisions follow.  \n   - Evidence: ESMO 1415P explores concordance and correlation with other markers.  \n   - Differentiate: Encourage retesting, pathology review, or multidisciplinary decision when results are borderline.  \n   - Takeaway: Use clinical and pathologic context, not PD‑L1 alone.\n\n9. “Combinations with cetuximab — are there promising partners?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Interest exists in combinations (ADC, NK‑cell engagers, IL‑15 superagonists).  \n   - Context: Some combinations (e.g., PD‑L1 + novel agents) show mixed results; safety paramount.  \n   - Evidence: Dana‑Farber t‑haNK + N‑803 + cetuximab trial (NCT06239220) shows active exploration.  \n   - Differentiate: Support mechanism‑based early‑phase work and careful translational readouts.  \n   - Takeaway: Encourage biomarker‑enriched small trials vs broad, unselected combinations.\n\n10. “Will MRD replace imaging for surveillance?”  \n    - Acknowledge: MRD has lead‑time for recurrence detection.  \n    - Context: Imaging still required for localization; MRD may prompt earlier imaging.  \n    - Evidence: TTMV‑HPV shows earlier detection correlating with worse outcomes.  \n    - Differentiate: Use MRD to prioritize imaging frequency and trial enrollment, not to eliminate imaging.  \n    - Takeaway: Operationalize MRD as an adjunctive tool while validating action thresholds.\n\n---\n\n## Evidence Generation Priorities (suggestive, not prescriptive)\n\nMedical Affairs may want to prioritize activities that protect and clarify cetuximab’s role, enable field readiness, and close evidence gaps that competitors exploit.\n\nImmediate priorities (high strategic value, low resource requirement; 0–3 months)\n- Produce concise ESMO‑abstract one‑pagers and MSL FAQs summarizing SKYSCRAPER‑09 (1348MO), ASPEN‑03 (1323MO), ADRISK (1320O), TTMV‑HPV (1366P), JCOG1212 RADPLAT (1337P), and LBA watchlist (Iza‑Bren, BURAN).  \n- Rapid literature/RWE synthesis: retrospective analysis of internal and external datasets to quantify cetuximab outcomes in PD‑L1 <1 and cisplatin‑ineligible cohorts (survival, QoL, hospitalizations).  \n- Convene a 1‑day internal expert debrief within 72 hours After ESMO to triage follow‑up actions and align MSL talking points.\n\nMedium‑term opportunities (6–18 months; moderate investment)\n- Sponsor or support investigator‑initiated RWE registries comparing outcomes for PD‑L1 negative patients treated with EXTREME/cetuximab vs alternative non‑IO regimens — collect safety, response speed and QoL endpoints.  \n- Diagnostic partnerships: evaluate feasibility of co‑developing lab‑agnostic guidance documents for ctDNA MRD (TTMV‑HPV and tumor‑informed assays) and create standardized clinical use algorithms for HNC surveillance.  \n- Small, mechanism‑driven investigator studies pairing cetuximab with rational immune‑engagers (e.g., NK‑cell modulators) in biomarker‑selected IO‑refractory populations — prioritize translational endpoints to avoid repeating broad combo failures.\n\nLonger‑term considerations (major investment; conditional)\n- Consider larger prospective trials only if compelling external signals emerge (e.g., ADC LBA displaces EGFR mAb in NPC and there is a need to reposition cetuximab). Potential options include pragmatic comparative effectiveness studies in cisplatin‑ineligible LA patients or MRD‑guided escalation trials where cetuximab is an option — but these should be considered only after cross‑functional and commercial feasibility review.  \n- Diagnostic co‑development (companion/complementary tests) for biomarkers that reliably select for cetuximab benefit would be valuable but requires high evidence thresholds and partner alignment.\n\nNote: Avoid initiating trials that closely mirror failed combinations (e.g., xevinapant + CRT in definitive setting) without mechanistic/biomarker rationale; the negative TrilynX phase III (PMID: 40902136) is an instructive caution.\n\n---\n\n## At ESMO: Priority Engagement (who, where, and what to discuss)\n\nSuggested KOLs to prioritize for meetings or quick touchpoints (dates/times are listed in the specialist reports; confirm final program onsite):\n\n- Hisham M. Mehanna — University of Birmingham  \n  - Key session: 1317O (CompARE perioperative durvalumab vs CRT) — 10/18 (Proffered).  \n  - Discussion points: perioperative IO survival and organ‑preservation tradeoffs; implications for cetuximab in cisplatin‑ineligible curative care.\n\n- Huaqiang Zhou — Sun Yat‑sen University Cancer Center  \n  - Key session: LBA35 (Iza‑Bren ADC in NPC) — 10/19 (LBA).  \n  - Discussion: ADC efficacy/safety and likely impact on EGFR‑targeted antibody use in NPC.\n\n- Kevin J. Harrington — ICR / Royal Marsden  \n  - Key sessions: mini‑oral on amivantamab/amivantamab programs and ASPEN‑04‑type trials.  \n  - Discussion: bispecific/ADC competitiveness and post‑IO strategies.\n\n- Robert Haddad — Dana‑Farber  \n  - Key session: mini‑oral on novel checkpoint combos.  \n  - Discussion: interpretation of combination safety signals and potential cetuximab combo roles.\n\n- Elena Garralda & Christophe Le Tourneau — early‑phase/bioinformatics experts  \n  - Key sessions: INCA33890 (PD‑1/TGFβ bispecific), 1403P transcriptomic signatures.  \n  - Discussion: biomarker validation pathways and translational endpoints to pair with cetuximab in future research.\n\n- Myung‑Ju Ahn — Samsung Medical Center  \n  - Key session: 1415P PD‑L1 assay concordance poster (10/20).  \n  - Discussion: laboratory issues, PD‑L1 assay harmonization, and how assays change treatment eligibility.\n\nPractical on‑site priorities\n- Attend LBA sessions (especially LBA35 and LBA48). If a field team cannot attend, nominate rapid‑response delegates and plan an immediate internal debrief to synthesize implications.  \n- Schedule short, focused KOL touchpoints after their presentations (10–15 minutes) to capture interpretation and clinical intent. Be ready with concise slides summarizing cetuximab data and questions.  \n- For the busy 10/20 noon poster block (many HNC posters overlap), pre‑assign MSL coverage to top posters (TTMV‑HPV, PD‑L1 concordance, neoadjuvant toripalimab) and capture takeaways for the field.\n\n---\n\n## Post‑ESMO: Communication and Dissemination\n\nMedical Affairs may want to:\n- Host an internal ESMO debrief within 48–72 hours After ESMO for global/regional teams to triage follow‑up actions and update MSL materials.  \n- Prepare an external scientific summary for KOLs and HCPS that is factual, balanced, and aligned with regulatory rules (no promotional claims). Include clear safety highlights (e.g., SKYSCRAPER‑09 fatal AE balance) and actionable talking points for PD‑L1 negative patient counseling.  \n- Update payer/regulatory surveillance dossiers if LBAs materially change therapeutic alternatives (e.g., LBA35 or LBA48 positive results).  \n- Coordinate with diagnostics/market access teams if MRD/ctDNA findings (TTMV‑HPV) generate demand for testing guidance or reimbursement discussions.\n\n---\n\n## Leadership Considerations\n\n### Competitive Monitoring — triggers and suggested responses (suggestive language)\n- If LBA35 (Iza‑Bren) demonstrates a substantial OS benefit and manageable safety in NPC: leadership may want to consider commissioning a cross‑functional impact assessment (clinical, commercial, regulatory) to understand formulary/label implications and whether accelerated competitive responses (RWE or partnerships) are needed.  \n- If LBA48 BURAN shows positive OS in PD‑1‑pretreated patients: leadership may want to review post‑IO portfolio strategy and consider targeted investments or alliances in PI3K/related pathways or support RWE to define cetuximab’s role post‑IO.  \n- If MRD assays (TTMV‑HPV and others) move toward prospective utility and adoption: leadership may want to consider investment in diagnostic partnerships or funding prospective MRD‑driven investigator trials to maintain influence on emerging care pathways.  \n- If SKYSCRAPER‑09‑type safety signals for immune co‑blockade are confirmed in follow‑up: leadership may want to emphasize safety differentiation in communications and potentially support educational initiatives on toxicity management.\n\n### Strategic Investment Areas to consider (framing options)\n- Invest further in RWE to defend cetuximab niches (PD‑L1 negative, IO‑ineligible, cisplatin‑ineligible LA): relatively low cost, high impact.  \n- Consider funding or co‑sponsoring diagnostic standardization work (PD‑L1 assay concordance, MRD assay guidance) to reduce practice variability that erodes cetuximab indications.  \n- Monitor ADC/bispecific development closely; consider scientific collaborations or in‑licensing options only if competitive LBAs indicate durable OS advantage and large addressable market.  \n- Avoid heavy investment in combinations mirroring failed CRT add‑ons (learn from TrilynX negative Phase III, PMID: 40902136) without clear biomarker or mechanistic rationale.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Key Abstracts (select, with strategic relevance)\n- 1348MO — SKYSCRAPER‑09: tiragolumab + atezolizumab vs atezolizumab — modest ORR/PFS gains, mOS numerically improved (16.2 vs 13.6 mo), PD‑L1‑high subgroup signal, increased grade 5 AEs (10% vs 2.6%). Strategic: safety/biomarker caution for TIGIT combos.  \n- 1323MO — ASPEN‑03: evorpacept + pembrolizumab vs pembrolizumab — ORR 26.4% vs 18.3%; modest signal not meeting primary benchmark. Strategic: myeloid checkpoint combination heterogeneity.  \n- 1320O — ADRISK: adjuvant aRCH ± pembrolizumab — underpowered; EFS HR 0.81 (not significant); signal in HPV‑unrelated/CPS <10 subgroups. Strategic: adjuvant IO uncertainty.  \n- 1366P — TTMV‑HPV ctDNA: n=88; MRD+ associated with worse PFS (2‑yr PFS 11% vs 84%; HR 4.43). Strategic: MRD prognostic utility and surveillance evolution.  \n- 1337P — JCOG1212 RADPLAT (T4b maxillary): n=64; 3‑yr OS 68.8% vs historical 20% — local practice impact for T4b subgroup.  \n- LBA48 — BURAN: buparlisib + paclitaxel in PD‑1 pretreated R/M HNSCC — LBA; full data At ESMO. Strategic: potential post‑IO practice impact.  \n- LBA35 — BL‑B01D1 (Iza‑Bren) EGFR×HER3 ADC in heavily pretreated NPC — LBA; full data At ESMO. Strategic: ADC threat to EGFR antibody use.  \n- 1415P — PD‑L1 assay concordance SP263 vs 22C3 and correlation with TIGIT/CD155 — strategic for test‑driven therapy choices.\n\n### Priority KOLs (name — institution — ESMO involvement / value)\n- Hisham M. Mehanna — University of Birmingham — Proffered paper (CompARE, 1317O); perioperative/curative‑intent thought leader.  \n- Kevin J. Harrington — Institute of Cancer Research (UK) — Early‑phase immuno and bispecific programs; mini‑oral presenter.  \n- Robert Haddad — Dana‑Farber Cancer Institute — IO combinations and INTERLINK/monalizumab + cetuximab experience; useful comparator insights.  \n- Huaqiang Zhou — Sun Yat‑sen Univ. Cancer Center — LBA35 presenter (Iza‑Bren ADC); NPC expertise and regional influence.  \n- Elena Garralda — Vall d'Hebron — early‑phase/bispecific presenter (INCA33890); translational biomarker expertise.  \n- Christophe Le Tourneau — Paris‑Saclay — transcriptomics and early‑phase biomarker validation (1403P).  \n- Myung‑Ju Ahn — Samsung Medical Center — PD‑L1 assay concordance and durvalumab subgroup analyses (1415P).  \n- Jiajie Xu — Zhejiang Key Laboratory — neoadjuvant pembrolizumab + low‑dose chemo posters (1334P/1342P).  \n- Ingeborg Tinhofer‑Keilholz — Charité — organoid translational work, elderly RT analyses.  \n- Robert (or Erica) Haddad, Kevin Harrington, and Hisham Mehanna are high‑priority for discussions around perioperative IO, ADC impacts, and cetuximab combination strategies.\n\n---\n\nIf helpful, Medical Affairs may want a short MSL “rapid reference” one‑pager (2 pages) that summarizes the top 4 abstracts (SKYSCRAPER‑09, ASPEN‑03, TTMV‑HPV, LBA watchlist) with key numbers, suggested Q&A, and data‑driven talking points. I can draft that one‑pager next, or prepare a post‑ESMO quick‑reaction checklist for MA leadership to use depending on LBA outcomes."

    "analysis": "# Strategic Briefing: Colorectal Cancer — ESMO 2025\n\nPre-conference briefing based on ESMO 2025 abstracts (conference dates: 17–21 Oct 2025). This is a pre‑conference synthesis of published abstracts and LBA listings to help Medical Affairs, MSLs and leadership prioritize activities At ESMO and plan After ESMO.\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n- Where we stand: Cetuximab (Erbitux) remains an established 1L anti‑EGFR for RAS‑wildtype, left‑sided mCRC with broad real‑world use and predictable safety/tolerability; it is central to first‑line algorithms and to some rechallenge strategies. Precemtabart / Tocentecan (M9140) is an investigational CEACAM5‑targeted exatecan (Topo‑I payload) ADC in 3L+ CEACAM5‑selected mCRC; phase I expansion shows meaningful single‑agent activity (2.8 mg/kg Q3W cohort: unconfirmed ORR 31%, DCR ~72%, mPFS ≈6.9 months) but with significant myelosuppression (neutropenia ~43%, anemia ~38%). M9140’s value proposition rests on durability vs late‑line SOC and a robust CEACAM5 companion diagnostic and toxicity management plan.\n\n- Key ESMO signals to watch (most likely to affect our portfolio):  \n  1) BREAKWATER (1L BRAF V600E): encorafenib + cetuximab + mFOLFOX6 (EC+mFOLFOX6) shows superior response vs chemo+bevacizumab (China subgroup: BICR‑ORR 58.3% vs 35.7%; BICR mPFS 10.0 vs 7.1 mo); ctDNA early clearance strongly correlates with outcome. Implication: reinforces the value of an EGFR backbone (cetuximab) in 1L BRAF disease and accelerates ctDNA as an on‑treatment biomarker.  \n  2) ctDNA‑guided anti‑EGFR rechallenge (CITRIC — LBA33) and sequencing LBA (PARERE — LBA32): randomized data on ctDNA selection and sequencing may redefine re‑exposure algorithms for anti‑EGFR mAbs. Implication: increases the need for assay alignment and field education linking Cetuximab to ctDNA‑guided reuse.  \n  3) ADC landscape: DESTINY‑CRC02 (T‑DXd) final analysis (ORR ≈37.8%, mDOR ≈5.5 mo; adjudicated ILD ~9.6% at 5.4 mg/kg) and JSKN003 biparatopic HER2‑DXd (phase I: investigator ORR 66.7% in small cohort) confirm meaningful ADC efficacy but persistent ILD/myelosuppression risks. Implication: competitive benchmarks for M9140 on ORR/DOR and safety are being set.  \n  4) PROCEADE‑CRC‑01 (M9140) phase I expansion (962P): the M9140 signal (unconfirmed ORR ~31% at 2.8 mg/kg, mPFS ≈6.9 mo) validates CEACAM5 as a viable ADC target but highlights hematologic toxicity as the principal safety issue.\n\n- Top priorities for Medical Affairs at ESMO and immediately after:  \n  1) Attend and capture CITRIC (LBA33) and PARERE (LBA32) proffered sessions and interact with presenters to clarify assay thresholds and clinical algorithms.  \n  2) Prepare MSL Q&A and slides linking cetuximab sequencing guidance to ctDNA evidence, and proactively engage European KOLs driving ctDNA‑guided care.  \n  3) For M9140, finalize messaging on CEACAM5 selection, hematologic AE mitigation (G‑CSF/monitoring/dose modifications), and CDx strategy; gather comparator ADC ILD/myelosuppression benchmarks at DESTINY‑CRC02 and JSKN003 presentations.  \n  4) Track IO + EGFR + chemo triplet signals (Tesla) and organoid/functional precision tools (MOS) as potential future combination/selective strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Pre‑ESMO 2025 Colorectal Cancer Landscape\n\n### Current Treatment Paradigm\n- First‑line (1L): fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin or irinotecan (FOLFOX/FOLFIRI) ± biologic. Anti‑EGFR mAbs (cetuximab, panitumumab) are preferred for RAS/BRAF‑wildtype, left‑sided tumors. MSI‑H/dMMR tumors generally receive single‑agent PD‑1 inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab) in 1L. BRAF V600E historically used encorafenib + cetuximab in later lines but BREAKWATER is positioning EC+mFOLFOX6 up front.  \n- Second/third line (2L/3L): options include VEGF inhibition (bevacizumab), TKIs (regorafenib, fruquintinib), TAS‑102, and biomarker‑directed targeted doubles for small subgroups (KRAS G12C doublets: adagrasib + cetuximab, sotorasib + panitumumab). ADCs (HER2‑targeted T‑DXd) and next‑generation ADCs are becoming active competitors in 3L+.  \n- Where our assets fit: Cetuximab remains the established 1L anti‑EGFR for eligible patients. M9140 is a 3L+ investigational ADC for CEACAM5‑expressing, MSS/pMMR mCRC—aimed at the high‑unmet‑need chemorefractory population.\n\n### Key evidence supporting current positioning\n- Cetuximab: long registrational and real‑world experience; PREMIUM real‑world PFS ≈11.0 months in 1L RAS WT. Rechallenge evidence (e.g., JACCRO CC‑08 irinotecan + cetuximab) supports selective re‑use where patients had prior benefit and long cetuximab‑free intervals.  \n- M9140: PROCEADE CRC‑01 phase I expansion shows activity in heavily pretreated, CEACAM5‑expressing pts (2.8 mg/kg Q3W unconfirmed ORR ~31%, DCR ~72%, mPFS ≈6.9 mo), establishing a signal to pursue registrational planning with a CEACAM5 companion diagnostic.\n\n### Testing / diagnostic landscape relevant to our assets\n- Standard: tumor RAS/BRAF testing and primary tumor sidedness guide anti‑EGFR use.  \n- Emerging: ctDNA is moving from prognostic to actionable (INTERCEPT, PEGASUS, CITRIC) — tumor‑informed mutation panels and methylation assays are both in active use; assay heterogeneity complicates cross‑trial comparability.  \n- For M9140: CEACAM5 expression selection (IHC or validated molecular assay) is central—defining and validating a reproducible CDx will be essential for registration and local uptake.\n\n### Competitive positioning versus key competitors\n- Cetuximab vs panitumumab: multiple randomized and comparative studies (eg, WJOG6510G) showed non‑inferiority and in some analyses a PFS/OS edge for panitumumab‑containing regimens in specific late‑line settings. That dynamic creates head‑to‑head conversation points on interchangeability, immunogenicity, and practical preferences by prescriber. Cetuximab’s strengths are broad clinical familiarity and established combination data.  \n- ADC competition: T‑DXd (DESTINY‑CRC02) sets a HER2 ADC benchmark (ORR ~37.8%, mDOR ~5.5 mo) but carries ILD risk (~9.6% at 5.4 mg/kg). HER2 biparatopic designs (JSKN003) report very high ORR in small cohorts (66.7%) and need head‑to‑head safety/effectiveness benchmarks. M9140 needs to show either better durability, tolerability or a distinct niche (CEACAM5 positivity) to gain share.  \n- KRAS G12C doublets (sotorasib or adagrasib + anti‑EGFR): meaningful late‑line options (pooled sotorasib + panitumumab median OS ~13.2 mo, ORR ~26–30%) but target small molecular subsets and therefore do not displace EGFR use in RAS‑WT first line.\n\n### Evidence gaps and unmet needs (what ESMO may or may not address)\n- Remaining gaps:  \n  - Harmonized ctDNA MRD assay standards and prospective survival‑endpoint validation for MRD‑guided adjuvant/rechallenge decisions. (ESMO will present randomized ctDNA rechallenge/adjuvant data but cross‑platform harmonization remains.)  \n  - Optimal sequencing after ADCs and after IO; post‑ADC biology and salvage strategies are not yet defined.  \n  - Predictive biomarkers for IO + EGFR + chemotherapy combinations (why some MSS tumors respond to triplets remains unclear).  \n  - Real‑world data in elderly/ECOG≥2 patients and management of ADC myelosuppression in routine practice.  \n- ESMO will address parts of these gaps (ctDNA implementation trials, ADC single‑agent efficacy and safety, neoadjuvant IO signals), but durable OS evidence for many MRD‑directed strategies and standardized CDx pathways will remain incomplete.\n\n---\n\n## What's Being Presented at ESMO 2025 in Colorectal Cancer\n\nBelow are high‑priority studies (selected because they materially affect Cetuximab positioning or M9140 development). Abstract IDs are given where available; LBA items are identified as LBA and treated as late‑breaking.\n\n### BREAKWATER (1L encorafenib + cetuximab ± mFOLFOX6) — [751P / 729MO / 874eP]\n- Abstract/context: Global randomized phase III in untreated BRAF V600E mCRC (EC vs EC+mFOLFOX6 vs control mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab). Multiple ESMO entries include subgroup, biomarker and ctDNA kinetics data.  \n- Key data (from abstracts/reports): China subgroup BICR‑ORR for EC+mFOLFOX6 58.3% vs control 35.7%; BICR median PFS 10.0 vs 7.1 months. Paired plasma ctDNA detectability ~86% at baseline; early ctDNA conversion (detectable→undetectable by C2D15) correlated with markedly improved OS (HRs ~0.3–0.5 across arms; 729MO). Global BREAKWATER readouts have been reported in 2025 (Kopetz et al., Nat Med 2025).  \n- Evidence gap addressed: Establishes an EC + chemo backbone in 1L BRAF V600E and supports ctDNA as an early on‑treatment biomarker.  \n- Competitive implications for Erbitux/M9140: Confirms cetuximab’s central role in BRAF‑mutant combinations (positive for Erbitux positioning in this niche). For M9140: limited direct impact but competition for later‑line sequencing may change if more patients receive EC+mFOLFOX6 up front and derive longer benefit.  \n- MA use: MSLs should have slides summarizing BREAKWATER efficacy and ctDNA kinetics; be prepared to discuss sequencing implications for EGFR agents and implications for later‑line populations.\n\n### DESTINY‑CRC02 (trastuzumab‑deruxtecan; final randomized phase II analysis) — [737MO]\n- Key data: Confirmed ORR ~37.8% (5.4 mg/kg cohort); median DOR ≈5.5 months; preliminary median OS ≈15.9 months (5.4 mg/kg). Adjudicated ILD incidence ~9.6% at 5.4 mg/kg (higher at 6.4 mg/kg).  \n- Evidence gap addressed: Validates HER2 ADC efficacy in pretreated HER2+ mCRC; quantifies ILD risk with DXd payloads.  \n- Competitive implications: Raises efficacy expectations (ORR/DOR) and sets toxicity benchmarks for ADC competitors (including CEACAM5 ADCs). M9140 must demonstrate either comparable durability with acceptable toxicity or a differentiated niche (CEACAM5 antigen and different toxicity profile).  \n- MA use: Prepare comparative safety messaging (ILD monitoring) and collect investigator views on monitoring and ILD mitigation.\n\n### JSKN003 (biparatopic HER2‑DXd ADC) — [806P]\n- Key data: Investigator‑assessed ORR 66.7% (18 evaluable pts), DCR 96.3%, preliminary mPFS ≈11.0 months (immature). ILD in 3 pts (7.5%), mostly grade 1–2. Cohort small and early.  \n- Evidence gap addressed: Suggests biparatopic HER2 designs may increase response depth/duration vs single‑epitope ADCs—needs confirmatory data.  \n- Competitive implications: Further fragments the HER2 ADC competitive landscape; sets a high bar for ORR in HER2+ mCRC. M9140 is in a different antigen niche (CEACAM5), so direct overlap limited but ADC tolerability expectations will rise.  \n- MA use: Track expansion cohorts and cross‑trial biomarker/response durability.\n\n### PROCEADE‑CRC‑01 — Precemtabart / Tocentecan (M9140) — [962P]\n- Key data (phase I dose expansion): At 2.8 mg/kg Q3W cohort: unconfirmed ORR 31%, DCR ≈72%, median PFS ≈6.9 months. Hematologic toxicity: neutropenia 43%, anemia 38% (grade 3 rates substantial). No ILD reported. Activity across RAS/BRAF subgroups.  \n- Evidence gap addressed: Provides first‑in‑human CEACAM5 ADC activity benchmark in heavily pretreated MSS/pMMR CRC.  \n- Competitive implications: M9140 shows promising single‑agent activity vs late‑line SOC (TAS‑102, regorafenib) where ORRs are low; however, hematologic toxicity is a material practical hurdle for adoption and for combination strategies. M9140 must be positioned against ADCs for ORR/durability and against TKIs/TAS‑102 for OS/PFS benefit.  \n- MA use: Use ESMO to capture investigator experience on hematologic AE management, preferred CDx approaches (IHC vs molecular), and expectations for pivotal trial design (control arm, endpoints).\n\n### CITRIC — ctDNA‑guided anti‑EGFR rechallenge — LBA33 (Clara Montagut) — [LBA33, Proffered Paper]\n- Abstract status: Late‑breaking abstract (final results to be presented At ESMO). Design: randomized phase II, ctDNA‑guided anti‑EGFR rechallenge in metastatic RAS/BRAF‑WT left‑sided mCRC.  \n- What to expect / why it matters: If ctDNA selection markedly improves ORR/PFS for rechallenge, ctDNA‑guided re‑exposure of cetuximab/panitumumab could become standard practice for rechallenge — expanding the addressable population for EGFR mAbs and changing sequencing.  \n- Competitive implications: Positive CITRIC reinforces ERBITUX retention in the later‑line toolbox but also forces alignment on which ctDNA assays and VAF thresholds to use. For M9140 it shifts the late‑line competitive calculus (more patients may receive EGFR rechallenge before ADCs).  \n- MA actions: Prioritize attendance at LBA33; capture assay details (platform, sensitivity thresholds, timing); reach out to the presenting site to discuss potential collaborations or confirmatory RWE analyses.\n\n### PARERE — Panitumumab retreatment → regorafenib sequence vs reverse — LBA32 (GONO) — [LBA32, Proffered Paper]\n- Abstract status: LBA; randomized sequencing trial in chemorefractory RAS/BRAF WT patients comparing sequence orders (panitumumab then regorafenib vs reverse).  \n- Why it matters: May alter late‑line sequencing algorithms and payer considerations for optimal treatment order. A favorable sequence could drive preferential use of one anti‑EGFR agent earlier or later.  \n- MA actions: Attend LBA32, capture hazard ratios and subgroup signals (ctDNA status, prior CFI), and plan MSL talking points that contextualize Erbitux availability and interchangeability vs panitumumab.\n\n### PEGASUS — post‑surgical ctDNA‑guided adjuvant therapy — [723O]\n- Abstract status: Proffered paper (final results presented). Design: post‑surgical ctDNA guided adjuvant decisions in stage II/III colon cancer.  \n- What to expect: Data likely show adjuvant escalation/de‑escalation driven by ctDNA status; will further accelerate clinical demand for MRD assays and influence lab capacity/coverage discussions.  \n- MA actions: Track how PEGASUS handles assay type (tumor‑informed vs methylation), adjuvant regimens used, and downstream impacts on metastatic disease incidence—this matters for early demand for late‑line agents.\n\n### NICHE‑2 MAIC (neoadjuvant nivo/ipi in dMMR colon vs FOxTROT indirect comparison) — LBA724O\n- Key data (MAIC): Adjusted indirect comparison reported 3‑year DFS 100% for NICHE‑2 vs 80% for FOxTROT (log‑rank p<0.001); pathologic response rates substantially favored neoadjuvant dual‑ICI. Caveats: MAIC methodology limits definitive practice change.  \n- Implication: Strong hypothesis‑generating signal pushing ICI into neoadjuvant curative intent for dMMR; less direct impact on Cetuximab but changes early treatment paradigms, potentially reducing adjuvant chemo use and shifting long‑term sequencing needs.\n\n### ATOMIC (adjuvant FOLFOX ± atezolizumab in stage III dMMR) — [752P]\n- Key data: Atezolizumab + mFOLFOX6 improved DFS vs mFOLFOX6 alone in stage III dMMR colon cancer (HR ~0.45 for Lynch‑related, HR ~0.52 for sporadic dMMR; no significant interaction by dMMR origin).  \n- Implication: Supports expanding adjuvant ICI in dMMR; indirect impact on downstream metastatic treatment patterns.\n\n### Tesla (toripalimab + cetuximab + FOLFIRI in 1L left‑sided RAS/BRAF WT) — [866eP]\n- Key data (single‑arm phase II): n=43 evaluable; ORR 90.7%, DCR 93.0%; early tumor shrinkage 90.7%; median PFS 10.5 months; median OS not reached. Safety: rash, diarrhea; grade 3–4 AEs included rash and neutropenia ~6–7%.  \n- Evidence gap addressed: Suggests IO + EGFR + chemo can produce very high ORR in selected 1L left‑sided RAS/BRAF WT patients. Requires randomized data to establish additive benefit.  \n- Implications for Erbitux: If randomized trials confirm benefit, Erbitux could be central to paradigm shifts into immuno‑combinations in RAS WT left‑sided disease.\n\n### INTERCEPT (serial tumor‑informed MRD Signatera data) — [732MO]\n- Key data: In ~1,301 CRC pts, persistent post‑op ctDNA+ associated with short mDFS (~2.1–2.4 mo); persistent ctDNA clearance linked to mDFS ~16.9 mo. Spontaneous durable clearance rare (~1.7%); adjuvant therapy cleared ctDNA in ~26% of post‑op ctDNA+ pts, but only ~17% achieved persistent clearance.  \n- Implication: ctDNA clearance is prognostic but not invariably durable with current adjuvant strategies—supports MRD‑directed trials but cautions about ctDNA clearance as an OS surrogate.  \n- MA use: Use these data to temper expectations about MRD surrogate status in payer discussions, and to qualify claims in investigator conversations.\n\n### ColonAiQ / methylation and multi‑omic MRD tests — [763P, 1764eP]\n- Key data: ColonAiQ reported sensitivity ~87%, specificity ~91% across ~1,965 participants (CRC detection in screening). Methylation MRD assays report postoperative sensitivity ~50–60% in heterogeneous cohorts.  \n- Implication: Tumor‑agnostic methylation tests are improving but MRD performance still varies by platform and timepoint—CDx harmonization is required.\n\n### MOS organoid functional precision platform — [821P]\n- Key data: MicroOrganoSpheres (MOS) predicted patient response with 83% overall accuracy in 37 samples (21 patients); primary tumor‑derived MOS had 100% accuracy in a small subgroup; MOS sensitivity correlated with longer PFS.  \n- Implication: Functional testing could complement genomics for late‑line selection or rechallenge decisions—investigator partnership opportunities exist.\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Intelligence — short assessment\n\n- Highest immediate threats:\n  - ctDNA‑guided rechallenge (CITRIC LBA33): high. If positive, it will quickly change rechallenge practice and require assay alignment and updated field messaging for Erbitux.  \n  - HER2/ADC competition (DESTINY‑CRC02, JSKN003): moderate‑high. ADCs are proving clinically meaningful ORR; ILD and toxicity management will guide adoption and create comparator expectations for M9140.  \n  - Randomized sequencing (PARERE LBA32): moderate. A demonstrated optimal sequence could re‑order late‑line therapy pathways and influence payer coverage.  \n- Medium‑term watch items:\n  - IO + EGFR + chemo triplets (Tesla): promising single‑arm ORR but needs randomized confirmation; could expand use of EGFR in combination regimens.  \n  - KRAS G12C doublets: important but small population; relevant for sequencing discussions rather than direct displacement of Erbitux in 1L.\n- Practical takeaways: Prioritize KOLs and labs leading ctDNA implementation; capture ADC safety/efficacy details to benchmark M9140; monitor sequencing LBAs for payor and guideline impact.\n\n---\n\n## Evidence Gaps: What ESMO will address vs what will persist\n\n- Likely addressed (partially or in part) at ESMO:  \n  - Clinical validity and actionable thresholds for ctDNA‑guided rechallenge/adjuvant (CITRIC, PEGASUS, INTERCEPT).  \n  - Single‑agent ADC efficacy and safety benchmarks including ILD and hematologic toxicity (DESTINY‑CRC02, JSKN003, PROCEADE‑CRC‑01).  \n  - Signals that IO can produce high neoadjuvant and metastatic responses in selected subgroups (NICHE‑2 MAIC, Tesla).  \n- Likely to remain unresolved after ESMO:  \n  - Assay harmonization and regulatory/payer acceptance of ctDNA across platforms (tumor‑informed vs methylation).  \n  - Durable OS evidence that MRD‑directed adjuvant/rechallenge strategies improve survival (most ctDNA programs are promising but need longer follow‑up).  \n  - Clear, validated predictive biomarkers for IO + EGFR combinations and optimal post‑ADC salvage sequencing.  \n  - Real‑world feasibility/management algorithms for ADC myelosuppression and ILD monitoring in diverse health systems.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Considerations for Medical Affairs\n\nNote: these are strategic options and conversation guides. Teams may consider prioritizing items that align with local/regional needs.\n\n### Ten Strategic Questions for KOL Engagement (use at advisory boards / in‑region discussions)\n\n1. How should we operationalize ctDNA thresholds (platform, VAF cutoffs, timing) when selecting patients for anti‑EGFR rechallenge?  \n   - Why it matters: CITRIC (LBA33) is presenting randomized evidence on ctDNA‑guided rechallenge; INTERCEPT provides prospective natural history.  \n   - Relevance to our assets: Cetuximab will be front and center if ctDNA selects better responders; M9140 sequencing windows may compress if more patients are rechallenged.\n\n2. Given BREAKWATER, should cetuximab be positioned differently for BRAF V600E patients receiving EC+mFOLFOX6 up front?  \n   - Why it matters: BREAKWATER shows EC+mFOLFOX6 increases ORR/PFS in 1L BRAF V600E (China subgroup ORR 58.3% vs 35.7%).  \n   - Relevance: Erbitux is part of a validated 1L BRAF regimen—discuss downstream effects on subsequent lines and eligibility for ADCs.\n\n3. For CEACAM5‑directed ADCs, what CDx modality (IHC vs RNA/NGS) and cutoffs are acceptable to clinicians to identify candidates?  \n   - Informed by: PROCEADE‑CRC‑01 (M9140).  \n   - Relevance: Helps shape M9140 registrational CDx strategy and lab validation needs.\n\n4. How are clinicians managing ADC‑class toxicities (ILD for DXd payloads; myelosuppression for CEACAM5 payloads) in routine practice? Which monitoring and prophylaxis strategies are adopted?  \n   - Informed by: DESTINY‑CRC02 (ILD data), JSKN003, M9140.  \n   - Relevance: M9140 safety narrative must include practical management approaches.\n\n5. Is there a biomarker (spatial TME, TLS, Wnt/AP signatures) that reliably predicts response to IO + EGFR + chemo triplets?  \n   - Informed by: Tesla (866eP) signals and spatial transcriptomics posters.  \n   - Relevance: Would guide where to prioritize randomized testing of Erbitux in IO triplets.\n\n6. What does a clinically meaningful threshold of benefit look like for a 3L ADC (ORR, mPFS, mOS), from a clinician and payer perspective?  \n   - Informed by: DESTINY‑CRC02, JSKN003, PROCEADE (M9140).  \n   - Relevance: Helps set endpoints and design for M9140 pivotal studies.\n\n7. After ADC progression (HER2 or CEACAM5), what salvage strategies have real‑world activity?  \n   - Informed by: DESTINY cohort follow‑up and early ADC translational work.  \n   - Relevance: Guides M9140 sequencing strategy and investigator collaborations.\n\n8. Which ctDNA platform would you accept to de‑escalate adjuvant chemo in stage II patients (tumor‑informed vs methylation)?  \n   - Informed by: PEGASUS (723O), INTERCEPT, ColonAiQ.  \n   - Relevance: Impacts lab partnerships and payer conversations affecting downstream metastatic populations.\n\n9. How would you integrate organoid functional testing into late‑line decision pathways? Which patients benefit most?  \n   - Informed by: MOS organoid (821P).  \n   - Relevance: Potential investigator collaborations linking organoid selection to M9140 enrollment.\n\n10. For anti‑EGFR rechallenge, how important is the cetuximab‑free interval (CFI) vs ctDNA negativity? Should both be required?  \n   - Informed by: JACCRO CC‑08 (CFI effect) and CITRIC (ctDNA guidance).  \n   - Relevance: Directly informs Erbitux rechallenge guidance and field materials.\n\n---\n\n### Ten High‑Value Discussion Topics for KOLs / HCPs (each with angles and how our assets fit)\n\n1. ctDNA for re‑challenge vs adjuvant decision making  \n   - Angles: assay choice (tumor‑informed vs methylation), timing (post‑op vs on‑treatment), clinical thresholds for action.  \n   - Evidence: INTERCEPT (732MO), PEGASUS (723O), CITRIC (LBA33).  \n   - Asset fit: Erbitux role in ctDNA‑negative rechallenge; M9140 planning for post‑adjuvant/late‑line positioning.\n\n2. ADC class tradeoffs: efficacy vs ILD/myelosuppression  \n   - Angles: monitoring/mitigation protocols, dose selection trade‑offs, patient selection.  \n   - Evidence: DESTINY‑CRC02 (ILD ~9.6% at 5.4 mg/kg), JSKN003, M9140 hematologic profile.  \n   - Asset fit: M9140 differentiates on CEACAM5 antigen and apparently no ILD reported; practice implications for AE management.\n\n3. Sequencing algorithms for late‑line mCRC (EGFR rechallenge, ADCs, TKIs)  \n   - Angles: clinical criteria for choosing rechallenge vs ADC; the role of ctDNA and prior CFI; payer impact.  \n   - Evidence: PARERE (LBA32), CITRIC (LBA33), PROCEADE‑CRC‑01 (M9140).  \n   - Asset fit: Cetuximab re‑exposure algorithms; where M9140 becomes the preferred next step.\n\n4. EGFR agents in combination with IO: biologic rationale and safety  \n   - Angles: immunomodulatory effects of EGFR blockade, timing with chemo/RT, toxicity overlap.  \n   - Evidence: Tesla (866eP).  \n   - Asset fit: Opportunity to position Erbitux in future randomized IO‑combination trials if KOLs favor.\n\n5. BRAF V600E management and downstream sequencing after EC+mFOLFOX6  \n   - Angles: role of cetuximab in 1L, duration of benefit, subsequent targeted options.  \n   - Evidence: BREAKWATER.  \n   - Asset fit: Erbitux as a proven EGFR backbone; implications for patients reaching 2L/3L.\n\n6. Designing registrational endpoints for 3L ADCs (M9140) — ORR vs PFS vs OS  \n   - Angles: single‑arm ORR thresholds for accelerated approval vs randomized designs for full approval.  \n   - Evidence: PROCEADE (M9140), DESTINY‑CRC02 (T‑DXd).  \n   - Asset fit: Inform M9140 pivotal strategy and CDx requirements.\n\n7. Practical MRD implementation in community practice — costs, lab workflows, reimbursement  \n   - Angles: cost‑effectiveness (Genoa economic analysis 769P), lab throughput, clinician training.  \n   - Evidence: 769P, ColonAiQ (763P).  \n   - Asset fit: Erbitux supply planning for potential expanded rechallenge uptake; M9140's CDx lab needs.\n\n8. Organ preservation strategies in rectal cancer and non‑OS endpoints (cCR, PROs)  \n   - Angles: endpoints acceptable to regulators/payers, watch‑and‑wait selection criteria, follow‑up intensity.  \n   - Evidence: NICHE‑2 MAIC (LBA724O), policy poster on cCR (2323P).  \n   - Asset fit: Limited direct relation to EGFR/CEACAM5 but affects treatment sequencing and multidisciplinary care.\n\n9. Functional precision medicine (organoids) integration into trial design  \n   - Angles: feasibility of using MOS as an eligibility or stratification biomarker, turnaround time.  \n   - Evidence: MOS organoid (821P).  \n   - Asset fit: Potential companion approach to select M9140‑sensitive lesions in investigator studies.\n\n10. Real‑world tolerability and adherence with Cetuximab vs panitumumab — practical tradeoffs  \n   - Angles: infusion schedules, skin toxicity management, hypomagnesemia monitoring, resource implications.  \n   - Evidence: PREMIUM real‑world (cetuximab PFS ~11 mo), WJOG and panitumumab vs cetuximab trials.  \n   - Asset fit: Reinforce Erbitux practical support programs and nurse/derm education.\n\n---\n\n### Ten Objection‑Handling Frameworks (scenario → Acknowledge → Context → Evidence → Positioning)\n\n1. Concern: “CITRIC will replace empiric rechallenge—Erbitux loses use.”  \n   - Acknowledge: That is a plausible outcome if the LBA is definitive.  \n   - Context: CITRIC is randomized and LBA‑level; platform/assay specifics matter.  \n   - Evidence: JACCRO CC‑08 shows CFI predicts benefit; INTERCEPT shows ctDNA dynamics are prognostic but clearance is not universally durable.  \n   - Position: Erbitux remains valuable; teams might discuss implementing ctDNA‑guided pathways that include cetuximab rechallenge for selected patients.\n\n2. Concern: “M9140 myelosuppression makes it impractical.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Hematologic AEs are meaningful (neutropenia ~43%, anemia ~38%).  \n   - Context: High grade myelosuppression can be managed with prophylactic G‑CSF, dose modifications, and monitoring—comparison to other ADCs is needed.  \n   - Evidence: PROCEADE‑CRC‑01 shows activity in a heavily pretreated population; compare to hematologic profiles of other payload ADCs.  \n   - Position: Discuss mitigation strategies and planned registrational safety run‑in designs.\n\n3. Concern: “T‑DXd ILD rates are unacceptable.”  \n   - Acknowledge: ILD is a known DXd hazard.  \n   - Context: DESTINY‑CRC02 adjudicated ILD ~9.6% at 5.4 mg/kg and higher at 6.4 mg/kg—monitoring and early intervention are recommended.  \n   - Evidence: M9140 has not reported ILD in phase I; payload and antigen targeting differ.  \n   - Position: Emphasize antigen differentiation (CEACAM5 vs HER2) and reinforce AE surveillance planning for all ADCs.\n\n4. Concern: “Panitumumab is superior to cetuximab by WJOG data.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Some randomized analyses suggest non‑inferiority and possible PFS/OS differences in specific settings.  \n   - Context: WJOG6510G showed non‑inferiority (PFS 5.42 vs 4.27 mo) with borderline superiority signals; differences may relate to population and dosing.  \n   - Evidence: Real‑world PREMIUM shows Erbitux durable PFS (~11 mo) in 1L; head‑to‑head selection depends on regional availability and prescriber preference.  \n   - Position: Discuss practical tradeoffs (infusion vs SC, reagent/infusion schedules, adverse event management) rather than absolute efficacy claims.\n\n5. Concern: “KRAS G12C combos make EGFR mAbs less relevant.”  \n   - Acknowledge: KRAS G12C doublets are meaningful for that genotype.  \n   - Context: KRAS G12C is a small subtype (~2–4% of mCRC); sotorasib+panitumumab pooled median OS ~13.2 months (n=93).  \n   - Evidence: This does not materially reduce the larger EGFR‑eligible RAS WT population.  \n   - Position: Cetuximab remains core for RAS WT left‑sided disease; KRAS G12C is complementary in precision sequencing.\n\n6. Concern: “ctDNA is too immature to guide practice.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Assay heterogeneity and lack of harmonized regulatory standards complicate adoption.  \n   - Context: INTERCEPT and PEGASUS provide prospective clinical validity; randomized CITRIC may provide interventional evidence.  \n   - Evidence: ctDNA positivity strongly prognostic; conversion correlates with outcomes in BREAKWATER and other trials.  \n   - Position: Support evidence‑based, platform‑specific integration and local lab validation for clinical workflows.\n\n7. Concern: “Tesla’s 90% ORR is unrealistic—too good to be true.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Single‑arm high ORRs require confirmation.  \n   - Context: Tesla is a phase II single‑arm (n=43) with striking ORR (90.7%); requires randomized confirmation to isolate PD‑1 contribution.  \n   - Evidence: Prior IO combinations in MSS have been inconsistent.  \n   - Position: Use Tesla as hypothesis‑generating; emphasize need for randomized data before changing practice.\n\n8. Concern: “Organoids are not feasible at scale.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Scalability and turnaround are practical challenges.  \n   - Context: MOS organoid accuracy is high (83% overall) in small series; prospective trials are needed to demonstrate clinical utility at scale.  \n   - Evidence: MOS correlated with PFS in early series.  \n   - Position: Consider pilot collaborations to validate organoid selection in a M9140‑eligible population.\n\n9. Concern: “MRD de‑escalation harms patients by undertreating.”  \n   - Acknowledge: That is an ethical and clinical concern.  \n   - Context: INTERCEPT demonstrates adjuvant therapy clears ctDNA in a minority; PEGASUS will inform which patients can safely avoid chemo.  \n   - Evidence: Randomized DYNAMIC‑style trials remain important.  \n   - Position: Advocate for adopting MRD only when assay‑specific utility and safety data are robust.\n\n10. Concern: “After ADC failure, nothing else works.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Salvage after ADCs is a real unmet need.  \n   - Context: Post‑ADC resistance biology is incompletely understood; translational posters at ESMO (spatial transcriptomics) begin to map mechanisms.  \n   - Evidence: Early translational data suggest stromal/immune microenvironment influence.  \n   - Position: Propose that M9140 development include planned translational biopsies and salvage cohorts to inform future sequences.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence‑Generation Priorities (strategic options, by time horizon)\n\nImmediate priorities (high strategic value, low resource requirement; start After ESMO)\n- Rapid field tools: Produce an updated Erbitux Q&A slide deck incorporating BREAKWATER, CITRIC LBA cues, and Tesla early signals; prepare a CEACAM5/M9140 investigator Q&A focused on hematologic AE management.  \n- Advisory board / KOL syncs: Virtual roundtables focused on ctDNA assay thresholds for rechallenge and CEACAM5 CDx requirements (invite CITRIC/PEGASUS investigators).  \n- Post‑hoc / RWE analyses: Query internal/commercial RWE datasets for outcomes of cetuximab rechallenge by CFI and real‑world ctDNA status (if available).\n\nMedium‑term opportunities (6–18 months; moderate investment)\n- Diagnostic partnerships: Evaluate partnerships or cross‑validation studies between CEACAM5 IHC and circulating CEACAM5 assays to define robust patient selection for M9140.  \n- Prospective investigator‑initiated studies: Support multi‑site ctDNA concordance/utility pilot (platform comparison) focused on anti‑EGFR rechallenge workflows; consider funding small randomized or biomarker‑stratified enrichment design if CITRIC signals are positive.  \n- RWE safety studies: Multi‑center observational cohort to document ADC myelosuppression and ILD monitoring protocols in real practice (benchmark M9140 vs DXd ADCs).\n\nLonger‑term considerations (major investment; only if strategically critical)\n- Registrational randomized phase III for M9140 in 3L+ CEACAM5‑positive mCRC vs investigator‑choice SOC (TAS‑102 ± bevacizumab or regorafenib) with PFS/OS co‑primaries and integrated CDx — pursue only after confirming a compelling benefit‑risk profile in expansion cohorts and clear CDx specifications.  \n- Combination development: If hematologic toxicity is manageable, consider rational combos (eg, low‑overlap TKIs or immune combinations) in biomarker‑defined subgroups—these would require robust preclinical rationale and careful safety staging.  \n- MRD interventional platform partnership: Participate in a multi‑sponsor MRD harmonization consortium to support widespread ctDNA adoption that benefits EGFR rechallenge pathway clarity.\n\n---\n\n### At ESMO: Priority Engagements and Sessions (practical guidance)\n\nHigh priority (must attend or debrief shortly after)\n- CITRIC (LBA33) — Clara Montagut — Proffered Paper, 10/18/2025 (Hamburg Auditorium): attend to capture assay platform, VAF thresholds, inclusion/exclusion and main outcome metrics.  \n- PARERE (LBA32) — Marco M. Germani — Proffered Paper, 10/18/2025 immediately following CITRIC: capture sequence‑specific HRs and subgroups.  \n- PEGASUS (723O) — Silvia Marsoni — Proffered Paper, 10/18/2025 (same proffered block as CITRIC): gather assay details and adjuvant management.  \n- DESTINY‑CRC02 (737MO) — oral or mini‑oral: capture final ORR/DOR/OS and ILD adjudication details and recommended monitoring.  \n- PROCEADE‑CRC‑01 (962P poster) — M9140: MSLs/investigators should attend the poster to gather investigator comments on safety management and CDx experience.  \n- Tesla (866eP poster) — attend to capture correlative biomarker hypotheses (if presented) to plan future trial design for Erbitux combos.  \n- INTERCEPT (732MO) — attend for MRD kinetics data and sample handling logistics.\n\nSecondary (good to attend if schedule allows)\n- JSKN003 (806P), MOS organoid (821P), ColonAiQ (763P).\n\nField operations note: MSLs are encouraged to schedule short, focused scientific check‑ins with presenting investigators immediately After their presentations (respectful of conference rules) to clarify details not in abstracts (assay cutoffs, CDx logistics, AE management nuances).\n\n---\n\n### Post‑ESMO: Communication & Dissemination (first 2 weeks After ESMO)\n- Produce a concise internal “Top 10 takeaways” memo for field teams (one‑page plus appendices with slide bank and FAQ).  \n- Host two regional webinars (EMEA / APAC+US) summarizing high‑impact LBAs (CITRIC, PARERE, PEGASUS, BREAKWATER) and M9140 updates; include KOL quotes and suggested local discussion points.  \n- Update M9140 development team with investigator feedback on CEACAM5 assay preferences and hematologic management practices captured At ESMO.  \n- Prepare payer‑facing evidence summaries focused on ctDNA cost/economic analyses (reference Genoa 769P) and ADC cost/monitoring implications.\n\n---\n\n## Leadership Considerations\n\n### Competitive Monitoring (what to track and triggers)\n- If CITRIC shows a statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS/ORR advantage for ctDNA‑guided rechallenge → leadership may want to consider accelerating: (a) assay alignment/discussions with major lab partners, (b) updated field education on rechallenge pathways for Erbitux, and (c) health‑economics modeling for ctDNA adoption impact on Erbitux use.  \n- If PARERE identifies a clear sequence that improves OS (eg, panitumumab→regorafenib or reverse) → consider reassessing Erbitux positioning in late‑line educational materials and revisiting local tender/substitution strategies where panitumumab is replacing cetuximab.  \n- If DESTINY‑CRC02 or JSKN003 expansion shows durable control with manageable toxicity and longer DOR than M9140 early data → consider prioritizing accelerated development milestones (e.g., randomized comparator selection, more mature PFS/OS endpoints) for M9140 or evaluating combination/salvage options.  \n- If Tesla/randomized IO combos produce confirmatory randomized benefit → prepare to re‑evaluate first‑line combo strategies where Erbitux is an essential partner in IO triplets.\n\n### Strategic investment areas (options to consider)\n- ctDNA/CDx ecosystem: consider strategic, non‑exclusive collaborations to harmonize assay thresholds for anti‑EGFR rechallenge (supports Erbitux lifecycle).  \n- CEACAM5 CDx validation funding: support analytic and clinical validation studies to reduce friction for M9140 adoption.  \n- ADC safety surveillance infrastructure: invest in investigator education programs and AE‑monitoring SOPs (ILD, myelosuppression) that can be leveraged across ADC programs.  \n- Functional precision tools: selective pilot investments in organoid validation studies with high‑volume CRC centers to accelerate personalized selection strategies for M9140 or Erbitux rechallenge.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\nKey Abstracts (concise list and strategic relevance)\n- BREAKWATER — 751P / 729MO / 874eP — 1L encorafenib + cetuximab ± mFOLFOX6;

However, guideline preference and market share have shifted toward 1L regimens with demonstrated overall‑survival (OS) benefit (pembrolizumab+axitinib, nivolumab+cabozantinib, lenvatinib+pembrolizumab) and durable IO/IO (nivolumab+ipilimumab). Practically, avelumab+axitinib still finds use in formulary/payer niches and in patients where clinician experience with axitinib or specific tolerability profiles is preferred.\n\n- Key ESMO signals to watch (that may change the landscape): 1) belzutifan (HIF‑2α) expanded late‑line activity data (LITESPARK subgroup; abstract 2607P) that strengthen HIF‑2α as a late‑line class; 2) biomarker‑guided front‑line assignment (OPTIC RCC RNAseq; 2591O) showing high response to nivolumab+cabozantinib in transcriptomically angiogenic tumors; 3) high‑impact theranostic and monitoring advances — CAIX PET/CT ([68Ga]Ga‑DPI‑4452; 2597MO) with superior lesion detection and tumor‑targeting signal, and tumor‑informed whole‑genome ctDNA MRD (Signatera Genome; 2609P) with strong prognostic performance; 4) practical real‑world tolerability/management signals (CaboNivo real‑world interim, 2626P) and early post‑ICI options (cadonilimab+lenvatinib, 2623P). Several LBAs (LBA94, LBA95, LBA93) are proffered and may materially affect sequencing or perioperative practice once full data are presented At ESMO.\n\n- Top strategic priorities for Medical Affairs during/after ESMO: (1) Rapid, nuanced field education and MSL‑talking points to address sequencing after avelumab+axitinib (late‑line HIF‑2α, IO‑rechallenge options); (2) targeted KOL engagement at ESMO to interpret LBAs and translational datasets (RNAseq, ctDNA, CAIX PET) and surface practice implications; (3) immediate RWE and post‑hoc analyses to highlight tolerability/dose‑management niches for avelumab+axitinib; (4) scouting partnerships (diagnostics/theranostics/ctDNA) to protect position in an evolving biomarker/theranostic environment.\n\n---\n\n## Pre‑ESMO 2025 Renal Cancer Landscape\n\n### Current Treatment Paradigm\n- Standard 1L care for metastatic clear‑cell RCC is dominated by IO/TKI doublets with OS evidence (pembrolizumab+axitinib, nivolumab+cabozantinib, pembrolizumab+lenvatinib) and the IO/IO doublet nivolumab+ipilimumab for certain patient profiles. Avelumab+axitinib is an approved 1L option (JAVELIN Renal 101: phase 3 PFS benefit vs sunitinib) but lacks the OS advantage that now drives guideline preference in many regions.  \n- Clinicians weigh tumor biology, patient comorbidity, expected toxicities and local reimbursement when choosing among doublets; sequence after progression typically moves to TKIs (cabozantinib, lenvatinib±everolimus, etc.) or clinical trials.  \n- Diagnostics increasingly intersect with treatment choice: transcriptomic/immune classifiers, ctDNA MRD and advanced PET tracers (CAIX, PSMA) are maturing and may alter selection, monitoring, and eligibility for theranostics.\n\n### Competitive Positioning — Avelumab + Axitinib\n- Strengths: Approved 1L label; familiar axitinib dosing and management; established PFS benefit vs sunitinib; operational familiarity for prescribers and some payer pathways.  \n- Limitations: No definitive OS advantage versus sunitinib; guideline preference is weaker than for OS‑positive doublets, translating into lost preferential placement in many formularies and prescriber algorithms.  \n- Near‑term threats: HIF‑2α targeted agents (belzutifan) gaining late‑line acceptance and being combined with VEGFR TKIs; robust real‑world support for competitor regimens (e.g., cabozantinib+nivolumab); biomarker‑guided assignment of patients to non‑avelumab regimens (OPTIC RCC).  \n- Practical commercial note: Avelumab+axitinib retains value where payer constraints, tolerability concerns, or physician experience favor axitinib backbones — this is an evidence and RWE communication opportunity.\n\n### Evidence Gaps and Unmet Needs\n- Key unanswered clinical questions relevant to our positioning:\n  - Optimal sequencing after frontline IO/TKI progressions (prospective comparative data are limited).  \n  - Validated, clinically‑actionable biomarkers to assign 1L regimen (RNAseq, spatial TME phenotypes, ctDNA MRD) — promising signals but not yet interoperable/validated for routine use.  \n  - Effective, tolerable strategies for IO‑pretreated patients — single‑arm phase IIs look promising (cadonilimab+lenvatinib, belzutifan), but randomized data are sparse.  \n  - Utility and workflow for ctDNA MRD in both localized surveillance and metastatic monitoring.  \n  - Robust data in under‑represented groups (elderly, ECOG ≥2, organ dysfunction, CNS metastases).  \n- ESMO will fill parts of the MRD/biomarker and post‑ICI sequencing evidence pockets but will not fully resolve sequencing comparative questions nor deliver mature OS readouts for many new modalities.\n\n---\n\n## What's Being Presented at ESMO 2025 in Renal Cancer\n\n### High‑Priority Studies Relevant to Our Portfolio\n(Each item shows the abstract ID, key data from the published abstract, what gap it addresses, competitive implications for avelumab+axitinib, and how Medical Affairs can use the finding.)\n\n- LBA94 — LenCabo (lenvatinib + everolimus vs cabozantinib) in ccRCC after PD‑1 ICI (Randomized Phase II; LBA)\n  - What is known: Proffered LBA; full abstract not publicly detailed in the preprint set. Trial tests optimal VEGFR/mTOR vs cabozantinib sequencing after PD‑1 ICI.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Comparative sequencing after PD‑1 progression.  \n  - Competitive implication: If one arm shows clear PFS/OS advantage and tolerability benefits, this could change 2L standards for IO‑exposed patients.  \n  - MA action: At ESMO, engage discussants and investigators to understand subgroup and safety details once LBA is presented; After ESMO, prepare Q&A for clinicians regarding where avelumab+axitinib patients fit into 2L pathways.\n\n- LBA95 — NESCIO (Neoadjuvant immunotherapy in locally advanced ccRCC) — (LBA)\n  - What is known: Proffered LBA; randomized phase II neoadjuvant IO to improve resectability/pathologic response. Full data pending.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Perioperative strategies and potential to alter downstream adjuvant/1L decisions.  \n  - Competitive implication: Positive results could expand neoadjuvant IO and change which adjuvant/1L regimen is used post‑resection.  \n  - MA action: At ESMO, prioritize the LBA presentation and surgical oncology discussions; After ESMO, consider implications for adjuvant claims and field messaging.\n\n- LBA93 — RAMPART (Adjuvant durvalumab ± tremelimumab after nephrectomy) — (LBA)\n  - What is known: Phase III adjuvant IO question presented as an LBA. Full data pending.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Adjuvant IO efficacy beyond pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE‑564) and whether dual‑checkpoint adjuvant improves DFS.  \n  - Competitive implication: A new adjuvant standard would increase the prevalence of IO‑experienced patients coming to 1L metastatic care — directly relevant to sequencing for patients who previously received adjuvant IO.  \n  - MA action: Track presentation closely; prepare post‑adjuvant sequencing guidance scenarios for clinicians who used avelumab+axitinib in the metastatic setting.\n\n- 2607P — Belzutifan (HIF‑2α inhibitor) vs everolimus (LITESPARK‑005 subgroup) — late‑line after PD‑(L)1 + 2 VEGFR‑TKIs\n  - Key data (abstract 2607P): In the subgroup with ≥2 prior VEGFR‑TKIs, belzutifan reduced risk of progression/death (HR 0.73 per abstract). Confirmed ORR was 24.1% for belzutifan vs 3.3% for everolimus (includes five CRs in belzutifan arm). Median OS similar (21.8 vs 18.1 mo; HR 0.94). Anemia was common with belzutifan (80.6%); discontinuation due to AEs lower with belzutifan (7% vs 14%).  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: A validated late‑line targeted class that is active after IO and multiple TKIs.  \n  - Competitive implication: Positions HIF‑2α as a meaningful late‑line option clinicians will consider before or instead of switching TKIs — could reduce use of TKIs alone in certain sequences.  \n  - MA action: Prepare comparative narratives on tolerability (noting high anemia rates) and sequencing algorithms; ensure MSLs can discuss monitoring/management of belzutifan‑related anemia vs TKI AE profiles.\n\n- 2626P — CaboCombo: Cabozantinib + nivolumab (real‑world 1L interim analysis)\n  - Key data (abstract 2626P): Interim real‑world cohort (n ≈ 156) reports ORR 60.0% (CR 6.4%, PR 53.6%), disease control rate 91.4%, median time‑to‑response ≈ 3.1 months. Dose modifications common: cabozantinib reduced in ~64% and interrupted in ~73%. Any AE reported 97.4%, serious AEs 42.3%.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Real‑world tolerability and effectiveness outside trial populations.  \n  - Competitive implication: Confirms CheckMate 9ER activity in routine practice and highlights practical TKI dose‑management burden compared with axitinib backbones.  \n  - MA action: Use the real‑world dataset to frame comparative tolerability/dose‑modification discussions with HCPs; collect local RWE on avelumab+axitinib dose intensity and AE patterns for side‑by‑side comparisons.\n\n- 2591O — OPTIC RCC: RNAseq‑guided assignment (angiogenic cluster → nivolumab + cabozantinib)\n  - Key data (abstract 2591O): Prospective assignment by RNAseq; cohort assigned to nivolumab + cabozantinib n=26; in 21 evaluable patients with ≥1 post‑baseline scan, 100% showed tumor reduction—71% PR, 29% SD; no PD observed in evaluable set; median follow‑up 9.8 months (3 progressions reported).  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Prospective biomarker treatment‑assignment feasibility and enrichment.  \n  - Competitive implication: Validated transcriptomic assignment could shrink the population where avelumab+axitinib is favored if other regimens are matched by biology.  \n  - MA action: Discuss feasibility, assay turnaround and tissue requirements with KOLs and diagnostic partners; consider feasibility of retrospective RNAseq analyses in JAVELIN samples.\n\n- 2603P — CLEAR subgroup: Lenvatinib + pembrolizumab in patients with baseline bone metastases\n  - Key data (abstract 2603P): In patients with baseline bone mets (L+P n=80; sunitinib n=89) median PFS 17.2 vs 5.6 months (HR 0.50), ORR 60.0% vs 27.0%; median OS numerically favored L+P (36.9 vs 31.5 mo; HR 0.67) but CIs crossed 1.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Efficacy in adverse metastatic sites (bone).  \n  - Competitive implication: L+P retains clinically meaningful activity in bone‑met disease and will be a go‑to option in this subgroup; avelumab+axitinib may be deprioritized here.  \n  - MA action: Equip MSLs with subgroup messaging and encourage local analyses of bone metastasis outcomes with avelumab+axitinib (if available).\n\n- 2623P — CLEAR‑IT: Cadonilimab (PD‑1/CTLA‑4 bispecific) + lenvatinib in ICI‑pretreated ccRCC (Phase II)\n  - Key data (abstract 2623P): N=24 evaluable; ORR 29% (2 CR, 5 PR), disease control rate 96%; median PFS 16.8 months. Any TRAE 83%; grade 3 TRAEs 12.5% (including hypertension, proteinuria, esophageal fistula).  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Effective IO‑rechallenge options in ICI‑pretreated patients.  \n  - Competitive implication: A promising post‑IO approach that could be preferred over single‑agent TKIs in some settings.  \n  - MA action: Capture safety management advice from investigators; discuss potential patient selection criteria and duration of response expectations.\n\n- 2604P — FIT‑001: KO‑2806 (FTI) + cabozantinib (Phase I)\n  - Key data (abstract 2604P): 27 patients treated (21 ccRCC, 6 nccRCC); 20 response‑evaluable: confirmed PR in 5/20 (25%); SD reported in 16/27 (59% of treated). Dose‑dependent grade 3 neutropenia observed (no neutropenia at 3 mg dose; higher rates at 5 and 8 mg). Activity observed in cabo‑naïve and cabo‑resistant patients.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Targeted strategies to overcome TKI resistance.  \n  - Competitive implication: Early signal that novel targeted combos can re‑sensitize selected patients; not yet practice‑changing.  \n  - MA action: Explore investigator willingness to share translational samples and clinical context for responders (prior exposures, IMDC risk).\n\n- 2609P — Tumor‑informed WGS ctDNA (Signatera Genome) for MRD and treatment monitoring\n  - Key data (abstract 2609P): Retrospective analysis n=77 (28 localized, 49 metastatic). In localized cohort any post‑definitive‑therapy ctDNA positivity associated with worse RFS (p<0.0001) — all ctDNA‑positive patients recurred. In metastatic cohort ctDNA clearance/serial negativity associated with improved PFS (p<0.0001). Reported sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 100% in the presented cohorts.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Validity of tumor‑informed WGS ctDNA for MRD surveillance and metastatic response monitoring.  \n  - Competitive implication: If adopted, ctDNA will alter surveillance and early intervention strategies — sequencing decisions may be made earlier and could change perception of durable benefit from various 1L regimens.  \n  - MA action: Consider ctDNA partnership pilots (local centers), and prepare clinician education on interpretation/limitations and possible clinical decision points.\n\n- 2597MO — [68Ga]Ga‑DPI‑4452 (CAIX) PET/CT for staging and theranostic potential\n  - Key data (abstract 2597MO): n=25 ccRCC; CAIX PET/CT detected 98% of regions vs CT 40% (of 45 regions). CAIX PET/CT changed management in 7 patients; mean SUVmax overall 74.8±43.6 (bone mets highest, mean SUVmax 139.2±126.9). Inter‑reader Cohen’s kappa 0.91. High SUVs support theranostic [177Lu]Lu‑DPI‑4452 exploration.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Improved staging sensitivity and candidate selection for CAIX‑directed RLT.  \n  - Competitive implication: New imaging/theranostic avenues may alter how and when systemic therapy is used; potential to create late‑line RLT niches.  \n  - MA action: Meet with imaging KOLs and nuclear medicine teams At ESMO to understand logistical implications and patient selection; discuss potential trial site lists for radioligand studies.\n\n- 2596MO — Ipilimumab + nivolumab + ciforadenant (A2A antagonist) Phase Ib/II\n  - Key data (abstract 2596MO): Enrolled 51 (50 evaluable); grade ≥3 AEs 34%; ORR 46%; >50% tumor shrinkage in 32%; median PFS 8.5 months. The exploratory adenosine signature did not enrich for response; IMmotion‑derived clusters correlated with outcome.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Role of adenosine pathway blockade to deepen IO responses.  \n  - Competitive implication: If validated, adenosine blockade could encourage intensified IO triplets for fit patients — altering how doublets are perceived.  \n  - MA action: Discuss eligibility and toxicity management with investigators; capture biomarker takeaways and their applicability to practice.\n\n- 2625P — RENALUT: [177Lu]Lu‑PSMA‑617 in PSMA‑positive mccRCC (trial setup)\n  - What is known: Trial design and rationale presented (PSMA expression in RCC neovasculature). No outcome data yet.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Late‑line radioligand therapy approaches for mccRCC.  \n  - Competitive implication: If PSMA RLT becomes feasible, this could add a non‑overlapping late‑line option.  \n  - MA action: Monitor trial start/enrollment and identify potential collaboration sites for real‑world registries.\n\n- 2592MO — FRUSICA‑2: fruquintinib + sintilimab vs axitinib or everolimus (Phase II/III randomized 2L; Mini Oral)\n  - What is known: Randomized 2L comparison with domestic IO/TKI combo in China (mini‑oral session). Full numeric results not supplied in preconference reports.  \n  - Evidence gap addressed: Regional 2L standards and potential erosion of axitinib/everolimus use in China.  \n  - MA action: Track full data release — regional market access implications could be rapid.\n\n---\n\n### Competitive Intelligence — short takeaways\n- High threat: belzutifan (HIF‑2α) cohorts (2607P) — validated late‑line target class with meaningful ORR and acceptable discontinuation rates; will influence post‑IO sequencing.  \n- Material near‑term impact: biomarker‑driven assignment (OPTIC 2591O) and transcriptomic classifiers — prospective enrichment can change front‑line choice.  \n- Practice/operational threat: Real‑world confirmation of cabozantinib+nivolumab activity (2626P) reaffirms a strong 1L competitor and highlights TKI dose‑management burdens.  \n- Emerging technology: CAIX PET/CT theranostics (2597MO) and PSMA RLT (2625P) will expand late‑line non‑systemic modalities and diagnostic selection.  \n- Regional risk: FRUSICA‑2 and other China‑led IO/TKI programs can create different regional standards and influence global perceptions.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence Gaps: What ESMO Addresses vs What Remains\n- Addressed at ESMO (partially): post‑ICI single‑arm options (cadonilimab+lenvatinib, belzutifan subgroups); feasibility of biomarker‑guided 1L selection (OPTIC); ctDNA MRD clinical validity signals (Signatera WGS); staging theranostics (CAIX PET).  \n- Likely to remain unresolved after ESMO: definitive prospective randomized sequencing algorithms (1L→2L choices), broad assay harmonization/validation for transcriptomic classifiers or ctDNA MRD, mature OS readouts for many new agents, and robust data in frail/elderly or ECOG ≥2 patients.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Considerations for Medical Affairs\n\nNote: the following is framed as options and considerations to support field teams (MSLs), Medical Affairs leaders, and clinical KOL engagement before/during/after ESMO.\n\n### Ten Strategic Questions for KOL Engagement (with context and ESMO anchor)\n1. After progression on 1L IO/TKI (including avelumab+axitinib), which 2L strategies do you prefer: switch TKI (cabozantinib, lenvatinib±everolimus), HIF‑2α (belzutifan), or IO‑rechallenge (bispecifics)?  \n   - Why it matters: Multiple ESMO abstracts address post‑IO options (2607P belzutifan, 2623P cadonilimab+lenvatinib, LBA94).  \n   - Relevance to avelumab+axitinib: Clinicians need practical sequencing algorithms for patients who received a PD‑L1 backbone with axitinib.\n\n2. Is transcriptomic assignment ready to guide frontline selection between IO/IO vs IO/TKI?  \n   - ESMO anchor: 2591O (OPTIC RCC RNAseq).  \n   - Why it matters: If validated, transcriptomics could reduce the empirical use of avelumab+axitinib in specific biology subgroups.\n\n3. How would you use tumor‑informed WGS ctDNA (Signatera) for surveillance or early intervention in resected or metastatic patients?  \n   - ESMO anchor: 2609P.  \n   - Why it matters: ctDNA MRD has the potential to accelerate treatment decisions and change follow‑up paradigms for patients we currently treat with axitinib‑backboned regimens.\n\n4. In which clinical scenarios (bone mets, liver mets, poor performance status) would you favor lenvatinib+pembrolizumab or cabozantinib+nivolumab over avelumab+axitinib?  \n   - ESMO anchors: 2603P (bone subgroup), 2626P (CaboNivo real‑world).  \n   - Why it matters: To help MSLs refine patient selection messaging.\n\n5. What is your practical approach to dose modifications and TDM for TKIs in combination regimens?  \n   - ESMO anchors: 2626P (real‑world dose reduction rates), TKI‑TDM protocol (no results yet).  \n   - Why it matters: Axitinib dosing flexibility can be a practical differentiator for avelumab+axitinib.\n\n6. How should clinicians manage severe anemia with HIF‑2α therapy (belzutifan) vs cumulative cytopenias from other lines?  \n   - ESMO anchor: 2607P (belzutifan anemia 80.6%).  \n   - Why it matters: Safety management is a primary determinant of regimen choice in late‑line care.\n\n7. Would CAIX PET/CT or PSMA PET change your staging or eligibility for local ablative/theranostic therapy?  \n   - ESMO anchors: 2597MO (CAIX PET/CT) and 2625P (RENALUT PSMA RLT start).  \n   - Why it matters: Adoption of new imaging alters treatment timelines and selection.\n\n8. How do you interpret early PRO/HRQoL changes as prognostic signals in TKI+IO therapy?  \n   - ESMO anchor: CheckMate 9ER HRQoL modeling (post‑hoc).  \n   - Why it matters: Early symptom changes could guide on‑treatment monitoring and switching decisions.\n\n9. For patients who received adjuvant IO (if RAMPART or other adjuvant results change practice), how would you modify first‑line systemic choices?  \n   - ESMO anchors: LBA93 (RAMPART, LBA) and general adjuvant RWE.  \n   - Why it matters: Adjuvant use increases IO‑experienced metastatic populations — affects how avelumab+axitinib is used upfront.\n\n10. Are there realistic ways to incorporate ctDNA or transcriptomic assays into local workflows (turnaround, cost, reimbursement)?  \n   - ESMO anchors: 2609P (ctDNA), 2591O (RNAseq).  \n   - Why it matters: Practical adoption constraints will determine clinical impact and our potential diagnostic partnerships.\n\n---\n\n### Ten High‑Value Discussion Topics (for MSLs / advisory interactions)\n1. Post‑IO sequencing algorithms — discuss belzutifan vs TKI vs IO‑bispecific options (2607P, 2623P, LBA94). Explore real‑world sequencing preferences and tolerability thresholds.  \n2. Biomarker‑guided therapy selection — practicalities of tissue RNAseq, AI pathology (2591O, 2624P), assay turnaround, sample requirements.  \n3. ctDNA MRD operationalization — when to test, how to interpret conversion, intervention triggers (2609P, 2660eP).  \n4. TKI dose modification strategies — when to reduce vs interrupt (2626P real‑world); role for TDM (TKI‑TDM protocol).  \n5. Bone metastasis management — evidence for lenvatinib+pembrolizumab (2603P) and local therapy integration.  \n6. Imaging and theranostics — CAIX PET/CT sensitivity and implications for site selection and RLT eligibility (2597MO).  \n7. Managing belzutifan toxicity — anemia patterns and monitoring (2607P) and how that compares to axitinib toxicities.  \n8. IO‑rechallenge strategies and bispecific antibodies — candidate patients and safety expectations (2623P).  \n9. Real‑world outcomes and health‑economics — use national registry data (e.g., France cohort 2632P) to discuss cost/benefit and patient selection.  \n10. Clinical care in vulnerable populations — gaps in trial evidence for elderly/ECOG≥2 and how to counsel these patients (use RWE and real‑world dosing data).\n\nEach topic can be discussed with 2–3 focused clinical questions, and MSLs may reference the listed abstracts as evidence anchors.\n\n---\n\n### Ten Objection Handling Frameworks (scenario → concise response approach)\nFormat: Acknowledge → Context → Evidence → Differentiation → Practical positioning.\n\n1. “Avelumab+axitinib has no OS benefit — why use it?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Valid concern.  \n   - Context: JAVELIN Renal 101 showed PFS benefit vs sunitinib but lacked OS superiority.  \n   - Evidence: Point to real‑world and subgroup scenarios where axitinib backbone and PFS benefit are clinically meaningful. Use CaboCombo real‑world (2626P) to contrast dose‑management realities across TKIs.  \n   - Differentiation: Highlight axitinib’s dosing familiarity and short half‑life enabling quicker dose adjustments.  \n   - Practical positioning: For patients where rapid tumor control, known tolerability, or formulary pathways matter, avelumab+axitinib remains a reasonable option.\n\n2. “Belzutifan looks better in later lines — does that make TKIs irrelevant?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Belzutifan shows activity.  \n   - Context: 2607P shows ORR 24.1% vs 3.3% for everolimus in a late‑line subgroup.  \n   - Evidence: Belzutifan has class‑specific toxicities (anemia ~80.6%). TKIs (cabozantinib, lenvatinib) remain options with different AE profiles and proven real‑world activity.  \n   - Differentiation: Treatment choice should weigh toxicity management, prior exposures and patient preference.\n\n3. “Why not always use biomarker‑guided OPTIC approach?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Compelling concept.  \n   - Context: OPTIC (2591O) is proof‑of‑concept prospectively assigning therapy via RNAseq.  \n   - Evidence: Small cohorts and assay logistics remain obstacles.  \n   - Differentiation: Until validated in larger, practice‑ready workflows, clinicians may use transcriptomics selectively in centers with capacity.\n\n4. “Post‑adjuvant IO: how do we treat relapse?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Increasingly common.  \n   - Context: LBA93 and adjuvant data change the IO‑exposed pool.  \n   - Evidence: Limited randomized data on post‑adjuvant recurrences; phase 2/3 and RWE will guide practice.  \n   - Differentiation: Decisions should consider time from adjuvant therapy, prior response and comorbidity.\n\n5. “HIF‑2α anemia is severe — isn’t that a deal‑breaker?”  \n   - Acknowledge: High anemia rates reported (2607P).  \n   - Context: Anemia was frequent but discontinuation rates were lower than everolimus in that cohort.  \n   - Evidence: Discuss monitoring and transfusion/ESA strategies; compare to TKI hypertension and diarrhea management.  \n   - Differentiation: Toxicity profiles differ — the choice depends on individual patient risks and treatment goals.\n\n6. “Triplets or intensified IO are better than doublets — why use avelumab+axitinib?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Triplet strategies are under investigation (e.g., adenosine blockade, ciforadenant; 2596MO).  \n   - Context: Triplets show promise in fit patients but raise tolerability questions.  \n   - Evidence: Use tolerability and real‑world dose modification data to frame patient selection; not every patient is candidate for triplet therapy.  \n   - Differentiation: Avelumab+axitinib may be preferable for patients where balance of efficacy and tolerability is important.\n\n7. “How do we respond to CAIX PET/CT staging that up‑stages disease?”  \n   - Acknowledge: New imaging changes staging sensitivity (2597MO).  \n   - Context: CAIX PET detected substantially more lesions than CT and altered management in some patients.  \n   - Evidence: Discuss false‑positive/negative rates, confirmatory biopsy and multidisciplinary review before major changes.  \n   - Differentiation: Imaging should be integrated thoughtfully; not every new positive should immediately change systemic therapy.\n\n8. “Why invest in ctDNA if it’s not actionable?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Implementation concerns are real.  \n   - Context: Signatera WGS (2609P) shows prognostic value and potential early detection.  \n   - Evidence: Serial ctDNA negativity correlated with improved PFS; some sites plan MRD‑driven trials.  \n   - Differentiation: Propose limited pilots where a clear management decision would follow ctDNA changes (e.g., intensified surveillance or trial enrollment).\n\n9. “Avelumab+axitinib dosing is inconvenient vs other regimens.”  \n   - Acknowledge: Dosing and toxicity matter to patients.  \n   - Context: Axitinib has a short half‑life and well‑established titration rules; TKI dose reductions are common across regimens (2626P).  \n   - Evidence: Provide practical guidance on titration and AE mitigation; share RWE on treatment continuity.\n\n10. “Why not wait for larger randomized data on new combos?”  \n   - Acknowledge: Good principle.  \n   - Context: Many ESMO abstracts are phase II/real‑world or LBAs.  \n   - Evidence: Use pragmatic risk–benefit discussions — early adoption may be reasonable for select patients; broad label shifts require phase III/OS data.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence Generation Priorities\n\nImmediate priorities (high strategic value, low resource requirement — activities to consider At ESMO or the week after)\n- Rapid field briefings and an MSL FAQ pack that addresses LBA topics (LBA94, LBA95, LBA93), belzutifan safety/efficacy (2607P), cadonilimab+lenvatinib (2623P), OPTIC feasibility (2591O), CAIX PET/CT (2597MO) and ctDNA MRD (2609P). Medical Affairs may want to schedule an internal debrief immediately After ESMO (suggested dates: Oct 22–23, 2025) to align field messaging.  \n- Post‑hoc analyses of existing JAVELIN Renal 101 datasets focused on clinically relevant subgroups (bone mets, elderly, prior adjuvant IO exposure) and tolerability/dose‑modification patterns — low incremental resource and rapid turnaround.  \n- Launch a concise RWE case series or pooled observational analysis comparing dose modifications, time‑to‑treatment‑failure and HRQoL between axitinib and other TKIs using partner registries (leveraging established collaborators in Europe/US/China).\n\nMedium‑term opportunities (6–18 months; moderate investment)\n- Multi‑center RWE study on sequencing patterns and outcomes after avelumab+axitinib specifically addressing 2L choices (cabozantinib, belzutifan, lenvatinib combos) — use propensity scoring vs published cohorts (e.g., French national cohort 2632P).  \n- Diagnostic partnerships to pilot ctDNA MRD (Signatera or similar) in avelumab+axitinib patients for early relapse detection and to generate longitudinal correlations with imaging.  \n- Validation study of RNAseq/AI immune classifiers using archived JAVELIN samples to explore whether specific biology predicts differential benefit vs competitor 1L regimens (build on OPTIC 2591O hypothesis).\n\nLonger‑term considerations (major investment; sponsor‑level decisions)\n- Consider a pragmatic, biomarker‑stratified randomized study in the post‑adjuvant or post‑IO progression setting that tests an evidence‑driven sequencing strategy — but only if LBAs/readouts create a clear scientific rationale and operational feasibility.  \n- Explore diagnostic/theranostic alliances (CAIX/PSMA imaging and potential RLT combinations) only after initial imaging/early‑phase therapy signals (2597MO, 2625P) mature and demonstrate clinical benefit.\n\nNote: avoid duplicative single‑agent approaches that have shown no activity in small trials (e.g., CDK4/6 monotherapy in heavily pretreated ccRCC — see earlier phase 1b abemaciclib data), and prioritize combinations driven by clear translational rationale and positive early signals.\n\n---\n\n### At ESMO: Priority Engagement (Who to meet / sessions to prioritise)\nMedical Affairs teams may want to consider prioritizing these people and sessions:\n\n- Laurence Albiges — Gustave Roussy: real‑world guideline/adoption discussions (poster 2618P); strategic opinion leader in Europe on sequencing and guideline interpretation. Topic: real‑world uptake, adjuvant implications and regional payer conversations.  \n- Clara Steiner — Dana‑Farber: COSMIC‑313 transcriptomic analyses (2606P) and invited LBA discussant — discuss RNAseq feasibility and implications of OPTIC (2591O).  \n- Rana R. McKay — UCSD: LAG3 and IO biomarker expertise (2593MO) and LBA discussant — discuss immune exhaustion markers and implications for IO/IO vs IO/TKI selection.  \n- Jiwei Huang — Renji Hospital: CLEAR‑IT cadonilimab + lenvatinib (2623P) — discuss IO‑rechallenge candidates and safety management post‑ICI.  \n- Alina T. Kuper — University Hospital Essen: CAIX PET/CT mini‑oral (2597MO) — meet nuclear medicine colleagues to understand implementation and patient selection.  \n- Adanma Ayanambakkam — Univ Oklahoma: KO‑2806 + cabozantinib early‑phase data (2604P) — explore translational correlates in responders.  \n- Zhenhua Liu — Ganzhou Cancer Hospital: FRUSICA‑2 (2592MO) — monitor regional 2L shifts.  \n- Pei Dong — Sun Yat‑sen Univ Cancer Center: regional IO+TKI combinations and SBRT integration (2602P, 2648P).\n\nSessions to prioritize At ESMO:\n- LBAs (LBA94, LBA95, LBA93) — attend live presentations and Q&A.  \n- Mini‑Orals: 2592MO (FRUSICA‑2), 2597MO (CAIX PET/CT), 3070MO (LY3866288 dose optimization — mechanistic watch), 2596MO (adenosine triplet).  \n- Poster cluster at 10/18/2025, 12:00–13:00 (many high‑value posters appear in this slot) — plan field coverage and digital capture since many top presenters present concurrently.\n\nSuggested discussion prompts for KOLs:\n- “Given your patient mix, how would a transcriptomic classifier change upfront selection?” (refer 2591O).  \n- “If belzutifan becomes widely available, which patients would you send to HIF‑2α vs a second‑line TKI?” (refer 2607P).  \n- “What would accelerate adoption of CAIX PET/CT at your center?” (refer 2597MO).\n\n---\n\n### Post‑ESMO: Communication and Dissemination (suggested, non‑prescriptive)\n- After ESMO, Medical Affairs teams may want to consider a structured internal debrief (suggested: Oct 22–23, 2025) to align field messaging and refresh the MSL FAQ.  \n- Publish a succinct “What At ESMO means for our field” slide deck (non‑promotional, clinically oriented) summarizing LBA outcomes, biomarker implications, ctDNA and CAIX PET/CT findings with suggested clinician talking points.  \n- Prepare targeted MSL talking points on sequencing, belzutifan safety, and how to interpret ctDNA/RNAseq findings in the clinic. Provide clear references to abstracts (IDs) and limits of evidence.  \n- Identify 4–6 local investigators who can provide real‑world context for practical implementation; field teams may want to request brief follow‑up interviews After ESMO to capture nuances not in abstracts.\n\n---\n\n## Leadership Considerations\n\n### Competitive Monitoring — triggers and suggested leadership watch‑items\n(If X occurs → leadership may want to consider Y)\n\n- If LBA94 demonstrates a clear 2L OS benefit for a specific sequencing strategy (e.g., lenvatinib/everolimus or cabozantinib), leadership may want to consider re‑prioritizing evidence generation for avelumab+axitinib patients moving to that 2L pathway (accelerate RWE, payer dossiers).  \n- If belzutifan combinations (2607P cohort expansions or other LITESPARK updates) produce OS gains or broad tolerability (despite anemia), leadership may want to consider investment in head‑to‑head or sequence trials only if there is a strategic rationale and feasible design.  \n- If CAIX PET/CT (2597MO) and early theranostic trials deliver reproducible staging‑to‑outcome benefit, leadership may want to evaluate diagnostic/theranostic partnerships to maintain visibility in late‑line modalities.  \n- If OPTIC (2591O)‑style biomarker strategies demonstrate reproducible outcome separation in larger cohorts, leadership may want to consider diagnostic alliances or retrospective assay validation in JAVELIN samples.\n\n### Strategic Investment Areas (considerations, not directives)\n- RWE and sequencing evidence to defend positioning in specific subgroups (bone metastases, comorbid patients, adjuvant‑experienced relapses).  \n- Diagnostic partnerships: selective investment in ctDNA MRD pilots and exploratory RNAseq validations that can produce real‑world clinical decision endpoints.  \n- Imaging/theranostics scouting: monitor CAIX and PSMA RLT activity — consider partnerships if clinical benefit becomes reproducible.  \n- Avoid large investments in mechanisms with weak clinical signals (e.g., single‑agent CDK4/6 in RCC) until strong translational/clinical data justify a program.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Key Abstracts (priority list)\n- LBA94 — LenCabo: lenvatinib + everolimus vs cabozantinib after PD‑1 ICI (Randomized Phase II; LBA).
