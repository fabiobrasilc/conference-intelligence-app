‚óè Help! Railway keeps timing out my Flask app's AI streaming responses after ~30 seconds

  Platform: Railway (Hobby plan)Stack: Flask + OpenAI API + SSE streamingIssue: ALL streaming responses       
  (chat queries, button responses) get killed after ~30 seconds with connection errors

  What we've tried:

  Gunicorn config tweaks:
  - Increased --timeout to 180s, then 300s
  - Tried sync workers, then UvicornWorker
  - Added --keep-alive, --graceful-timeout settings

  OpenAI client optimization:
  - Custom httpx client with controlled connection pooling
  - Reduced max connections (3), keep-alive connections (1)
  - Set explicit timeouts (60s, 300s)
  - Added retry logic

  Worker management:
  - Force worker recycling with --max-requests 5
  - Single worker to avoid complexity
  - Added shared memory temp dir /dev/shm

  Progressive loading architecture:
  - Split long analysis (90+ seconds) into individual 15-20 second requests
  - Created separate endpoints for list + individual processing
  - Immediate heartbeat responses to prevent proxy timeouts

  Dependencies cleanup:
  - Removed conflicting packages (gevent, uvicorn)
  - Clean httpx + gunicorn setup

  Current status:

  Still getting connection drops at ~30 seconds consistently. The pattern happens on ANY response longer      
  than 30s, regardless of optimization.

  Question: Is there a Railway infrastructure timeout that can't be configured at the app level? Has
  anyone solved long-running SSE streams on Railway?

  The app works perfectly locally, only fails in Railway deployment.
