# COSMIC Playbook Prompt Redesign - COMPLETED ✅
**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Status**: All 5 playbooks redesigned and tested ready

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS CHANGED

### **Core Philosophy Shift**
```
BEFORE (Academic):
- Audience: Medical Directors / VP Medical Affairs only
- Output: Comprehensive landscape briefings
- Use case: Post-conference strategic planning
- Example: "Pembrolizumab appeared in 87 abstracts (43% of IO studies)..."

AFTER (Hybrid Tactical/Strategic):
- Audience: MSLs + Medical Directors + Medical Communications + Clinical Dev
- Output: Tactical field guidance + strategic landscape context
- Use case: Pre/during/post-conference execution
- Example: "🔴 HIGH ALERT: EV+P data Friday 10am threatens avelumab. MSL response: 'Different paradigms - EV+P upfront combo vs avelumab maintenance...'"
```

---

## ✅ COMPLETED REDESIGNS

### **1. Competitor Intelligence** 🏆 (Lines 252-370)

**Changes:**
- ✅ **Added HIGH ALERT section** (🔴🟡🟢 priority system)
- ✅ **Field Response Scripts** for MSLs ("Likely HCP Question" + "MSL Response Framework")
- ✅ **Indication-specific focus** (avelumab 1L la/mUC, tepotinib mNSCLC MET+, cetuximab la/mHNSCC/mCRC)
- ✅ **White Space Analysis** (what competitors are NOT doing)
- ✅ **Hybrid structure**: Tactical alerts first → then strategic landscape

**Prompt Length**: ~118 lines (was ~84) - within <200 target ✓

**Output Structure:**
1. **IMMEDIATE COMPETITIVE ALERTS** → MSLs know what to respond to
2. **COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE OVERVIEW** → Medical Directors get strategic context
3. **TOP COMPETITOR DEEP-DIVE** → Quantified threat assessment
4. **WHITE SPACE & OPPORTUNITIES** → Where EMD can differentiate
5. **INSTITUTIONAL & KOL COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE** → Engagement implications

---

### **2. KOL Analysis** 👥 (Lines 371-523)

**Changes:**
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed line 447 "avoid tactical engagement recommendations"
- ✅ **Tier 1/2/3 System** (Must-meet / Strategic opportunities / Monitor only)
- ✅ **Engagement Approach** per KOL (When/Where, Discussion Topics, Strategic Objective)
- ✅ **Portfolio Relevance** with Abstract # citations
- ✅ **Research Specialization Summary** (TAs, modalities, biomarkers)

**Prompt Length**: ~150 lines (was ~80) - within <200 target ✓

**Output Structure:**
1. **TIER 1 KOL ENGAGEMENT PRIORITIES** → MSLs know who to meet + what to discuss
2. **TIER 2 KOL STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES** → Emerging leaders, geographic targets
3. **TIER 3 KOL MONITORING** → Heavy competitor focus, deprioritize
4. **COLLECTIVE KOL LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS** → Strategic patterns for leadership
5. **NOTABLE RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS** → Key presentations to attend
6. **ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY SUMMARY** → Field priorities + leadership planning

**Before vs After Example:**
```
BEFORE: "Dr. Necchi presents 8 abstracts in GU oncology with expertise in
urothelial carcinoma and FGFR3 biomarker research. [Academic profile continues...]"

AFTER:
TIER 1: Dr. Andrea Necchi (Fondazione IRCCS, Milan, Italy) - 8 abstracts
WHY TIER 1: ✅ Bladder cancer focus + FGFR3 research + European thought leader
ENGAGEMENT APPROACH:
- When/Where: Friday Oct 18, 10:30 AM, Hall B (Abstract #1847)
- Discussion Topics: FGFR3 testing infrastructure, cisplatin-ineligible patients, RWE study interest
- Strategic Objective: Assess advisory board interest + Italian RWE study
```

---

### **3. Strategic Recommendations** 📋 (Lines 741-926)

**Changes:**
- ✅ **EXPANDED**: From 38 lines → ~180 lines (was severely underspecified)
- ✅ **90-Day Tactical Priorities** with specific KOL names + engagement objectives
- ✅ **Medical Communications Key Messages** (exact 2-3 sentence positioning statements)
- ✅ **Clinical Development Proposals** (Trial concepts with investigators + timeline)
- ✅ **Market Access Considerations** (payer questions, value dossier updates, RWE gaps)
- ✅ **30/60/90-Day Deliverables** with success metrics

**Prompt Length**: ~180 lines (was 38) - within <200 target ✓

**Output Structure:**
1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** → 3-5 strategic imperatives for leadership
2. **CURRENT COMPETITIVE POSITION ASSESSMENT** → Where EMD drug sits in paradigm
3. **COMPETITIVE THREATS** → Top 3-5 direct threats with response strategies
4. **WHITE SPACE & OPPORTUNITIES** → Underserved populations, treatment gaps, combination opportunities
5. **TACTICAL PRIORITIES - NEXT 90 DAYS**:
   - **MSL Field Priorities**: 3-5 named Tier 1 KOLs with engagement plans
   - **Medical Communications**: 3 exact key messages with evidence
   - **Clinical Development**: Trial concepts + biomarker strategies
   - **Market Access**: Payer preparation + RWE priorities
6. **ACCOUNTABILITY & NEXT STEPS** → 30/60/90-day deliverables

**Critical Addition:**
```
**Key Message 1** - [EMD Differentiation]:
- **Message**: "[2-3 sentence positioning statement]"
- **Supporting Evidence**: (Abstract #s)
- **Target Audience**: [Oncologists treating this indication]
- **Channel**: [Congress materials/webinar/publications]
```

This gives Medical Communications ACTUAL MESSAGES, not "develop key messages" vagueness.

---

### **4. Scientific Insights** 📈 (Lines 597-740)

**Changes:**
- ✅ **Added Anti-Hallucination Safeguards** (only discuss what's in biomarker table)
- ✅ **Added TGCT Disambiguation**
- ✅ **Kept EMD Portfolio Scientific Context** (already had this - lines 703-719)

**Prompt Length**: ~143 lines (was ~140) - minimal change, already good ✓

**Output Structure:**
1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** → 3-5 dominant scientific themes
2. **BIOMARKER & MOLECULAR LANDSCAPE** → PD-L1, FGFR, MET, HER2, KRAS, ctDNA trends
3. **MECHANISM OF ACTION TRENDS** → ADCs, checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapy, DDR
4. **TREATMENT PARADIGM EVOLUTION** → Neoadjuvant/adjuvant, maintenance, combinations
5. **CLINICAL ENDPOINTS & EVIDENCE QUALITY** → OS vs PFS, pCR, MRD, RWE
6. **UNMET NEEDS & RESEARCH GAPS** → What's NOT being studied
7. **EMD PORTFOLIO SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT**:
   - Avelumab: PD-L1/IO momentum, IO+chemo trends, maintenance paradigm
   - Tepotinib: MET biomarker activity, competitive MET landscape, NSCLC positioning
   - Cetuximab: EGFR/RAS research, anti-EGFR momentum, biomarker refinement
8. **NOTABLE SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS** → 8-12 paradigm-shifting abstracts

---

### **5. Academic Partnership Opportunities** 🏥 (Lines 524-698)
*(Formerly "Institution Analysis")*

**Changes:**
- ✅ **RENAMED**: "Institution Analysis" → "Academic Partnership Opportunities"
- ✅ **Reframed for Medical Directors** planning collaborations (not MSL field work)
- ✅ **Tier 1/2/3 Partnership Prioritization** (not just research volume ranking)
- ✅ **Partnership Feasibility Assessment** (Access, Infrastructure, Geography)
- ✅ **Partnership Models** (Investigator-initiated trials, RWE, biomarker development, advisory boards)

**Prompt Length**: ~173 lines (was ~70) - within <200 target ✓

**Output Structure:**
1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** → Partnership landscape overview
2. **TIER 1 PARTNERSHIP TARGETS** → 5-8 high-priority institutions with:
   - Why Tier 1 (EMD-relevant TAs + accessible + infrastructure)
   - Partnership Opportunities (investigator-initiated trials, RWE, biomarker research)
   - Research Specialization
   - Partnership Feasibility (Access/Infrastructure/Geography scoring)
3. **TIER 2 STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES** → Emerging centers, geographic targets

5. **INSTITUTIONAL LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS** → TA specialization, modality strengths, geographic hubs
6. **PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS** → 90-day priorities, partnership models, success metrics

**Focus Shift:**
```
BEFORE: "Memorial Sloan Kettering presented 23 abstracts in GU oncology,
demonstrating strong institutional capabilities in bladder cancer research..."

AFTER:
TIER 1: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, US) - 23 abstracts
WHY TIER 1: ✅ Strong GU oncology (14 bladder/renal) ✅ Phase 3 trial infrastructure ✅ US-based (easier contracting)
PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:
- Investigator-Initiated Trials: Avelumab maintenance RWE study
- Advisory Board: 3 top GU KOLs from this institution (cross-ref KOL Analysis)
- Biomarker Research: FGFR3/PD-L1 companion diagnostic validation
PARTNERSHIP FEASIBILITY: ACCESS: High | INFRASTRUCTURE: Excellent | GEOGRAPHY: Optimal
```

## 🛡️ CROSS-CUTTING IMPROVEMENTS (ALL 5 PROMPTS)

### **1. Anti-Hallucination Safeguards**
Every prompt now includes:
```
**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
- ONLY use information from provided data tables - never invent Abstract #s or KOL names
- If data isn't in the table, write "not available in dataset" - do not speculate
- Presentation times/dates must come from Date/Time columns when available
- When uncertain about any detail, omit rather than guess
```

**Why this matters**: Prevents AI from making up fake Abstract #s like "#9999" or inventing KOL names that don't exist in the dataset.

---

### **2. TGCT Disambiguation**
Every prompt mentioning TGCT/pimicotinib now includes:
```
**TGCT Clarification** (if applicable):
- TGCT = Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (PVNS), NOT testicular germ cell tumor
- Pimicotinib is for tenosynovial/joint tumor indication
- If "TGCT" appears in abstract title, verify joint/synovial context, exclude testicular cancer
```

**Why this matters**: Solves your reported issue where AI was picking up testicular germ cell tumor abstracts when analyzing TGCT/pimicotinib data.

---

### **3. Indication-Specific EMD Context**
All prompts now specify exact EMD drug indications:
```
- **Avelumab**: 1L locally advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma (la/mUC), maintenance therapy post-platinum chemotherapy
- **Tepotinib**: 1L metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC) with MET exon 14 skipping mutations (METx14) or other MET-driven tumors
- **Cetuximab (H&N)**: 1L locally advanced/metastatic head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (la/mHNSCC)
- **Cetuximab (CRC)**: 1L metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), RAS wild-type
```

**Why this matters**: Ensures AI focuses on the right competitive threats (e.g., EV+P in 1L bladder, not pembrolizumab across all indications).

---

### **4. Alert Priority System** (Competitor Intelligence)
Consistent 🔴🟡🟢 system:
```
🔴 HIGH ALERT: Practice-changing data requiring immediate MSL response (within 7 days)
🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY: Monitor and respond if HCPs ask (within 30 days)
🟢 LOW PRIORITY: Baseline competitor activity, no urgent action required
```

**Why this matters**: MSLs scan for red flags first instead of reading 20-paragraph landscape analyses.

---

### **5. Hybrid Audience**
Every prompt now explicitly states:
```
**Audience**: Hybrid - MSLs need tactical guidance, Medical Directors need strategic landscape
```

**Why this matters**: Satisfies your requirement that "anyone from the company derives value" (not just Medical Directors).

|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Competitor Intelligence | ~84 lines | ~118 lines | ✅ <200 |
| KOL Analysis | ~80 lines | ~150 lines | ✅ <200 |
| Strategic Recommendations | **38 lines** | **~180 lines** | ✅ <200 (huge expansion) |
| Scientific Insights | ~140 lines | ~143 lines | ✅ <200 (minimal change) |
| Academic Partnership | ~70 lines | ~173 lines | ✅ <200 |

**Total prompt additions**: ~350 lines across all playbooks
**Philosophy**: More directive prompts with specific output structures, not generic "analyze this" requests
