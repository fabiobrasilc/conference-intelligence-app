    "analysis": "# Strategic Briefing: Lung Cancer — ESMO 2025\n\nPre-conference briefing (based on ESMO 2025 abstracts). Date: 14 Oct 2025. This is a PRE‑CONFERENCE intelligence synthesis to inform Medical Affairs, MSLs and leadership going into ESMO (Oct 17–21, 2025).\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nTepotinib (Tepmetko) enters ESMO 2025 with a strong, defensible position for MET exon 14 skipping (METex14) NSCLC: the VISION program’s long‑term follow‑up being presented at ESMO (1996P, 1995P) reinforces durable systemic responses and meaningful intracranial activity, and our plasma CDx pathway helps capture patients who are tissue‑challenged. However, the MET landscape at ESMO is active and fragmented: ADCs (telisotuzumab vedotin and new ADC designs), EGFR+MET combination strategies (savolitinib + osimertinib), bispecifics (amivantamab SC), and next‑generation MET TKIs are all presenting data that could change physician choice, diagnostic workflows and sequencing algorithms.\n\nThe most important ESMO 2025 items to watch (based on abstracts):\n- VISION 3‑year update (1996P/1995P): confirms durable responses and intracranial benefit with tepotinib, and shows stronger outcomes when used earlier (1L) — this is our central clinical differentiator.\n- SACHI/SAVANNAH program (1954P/1955P): ctDNA clearance and PFS signals for savolitinib+osimertinib vs chemotherapy, plus combination safety signals (edema, hepatotoxicity, VTE) — this shapes the EGFR+MET resistance niche.\n- Telisotuzumab vedotin (LUMINOSITY: 1948P/1951P/1950P): CDx (VENTANA MET SP44) concordance and toxicity-management data operationalize ADC adoption for c‑MET IHC‑high patients.\n- New MET TKIs / ADC innovations (928P DO‑2, 1946P MYTX‑011, KUNPENG vebreltinib): early signals of high ORR or differentiated tolerability that create medium‑term threats if confirmed.\n\nTop priorities for Medical Affairs during and after ESMO:\n- Protect and amplify Tepotinib’s differentiators (durability, intracranial activity, plasma CDx) in field messaging and payer conversations.\n- Rapidly equip MSLs with concrete comparator data (efficacy, DoR, intracranial outcomes, safety profiles and diagnostic criteria) and objection handling for ADCs, bispecifics and EGFR+MET combos.\n- Use ESMO momentum to accelerate pragmatic evidence generation: diagnostic harmonization work, prospective/observational ctDNA monitoring in METex14 patients, and real‑world sequencing datasets capturing post‑ADC/bispecific outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Pre‑ESMO 2025 Lung Cancer Landscape\n\n### Current Treatment Paradigm\n- Clinical context: METex14 skipping mutations occur in ~3–4% of NSCLC and represent a validated oncogenic driver. Current guideline practice places selective MET TKIs as the preferred targeted therapy for METex14.\n- Where Tepotinib fits: Tepotinib (Tepmetko) is an approved selective MET TKI for metastatic NSCLC with METex14. VISION (NCT02864992) is our core evidence base and is being highlighted at ESMO (1996P/1995P).\n- Key evidence supporting positioning:\n  - VISION 3‑year follow‑up (1996P): tissue‑positive cohort (n=208) ORR 54.8%, median DOR 17.4 months, mPFS 13.7 months, mOS 22.3 months; first‑line tissue‑positive subgroup (n=111) ORR 59.5%, mDOR 31.7 months.\n  - VISION sequencing analysis (1995P) shows superior durability when tepotinib is used earlier (1L ORR 57.9%, mDOR 31.7 months; 2L+ ORR 45.0%, mDOR 12.6 months).\n- Diagnostics and access: METex14 detection requires splice‑aware RNA/NGS or sensitive assays; VISION demonstrated use of tissue and liquid testing (tissue+/liquid+ subgroups). A plasma CDx pathway increases capture of patients who cannot undergo tissue biopsy, which supports uptake in real‑world settings.\n\n### Competitive Positioning\n- Strengths for Tepotinib\n  - Durable responses (VISION mDOR up to 31.7 months in 1L) and documented intracranial activity (VISION and REAL‑MET confirm intracranial responses).\n  - Established label for METex14 and availability of plasma CDx to identify patients.\n  - Familiar safety profile for clinicians (class AE profile: peripheral edema, mild hepatic effects); long‑term safety consistent with prior reports.\n- Key competitors and how they differ\n  - Capmatinib (GEOMETRY): validated TKI with strong ORR in 1L historically (reported ~68% in 1L cohorts), direct peer.\n  - Vebreltinib (bozitinib; KUNPENG): Phase II reports high ORR (75%), long DoR/mPFS (mDoR 15.9 mo; mPFS 14.1 mo) — strong regional competitor in China.\n  - Telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso‑V, AbbVie): ADC for c‑MET IHC‑high patients — ORR ~28.6% overall, higher in c‑MET high (~34.6%); has CDx (VENTANA MET SP44) and ADC‑specific toxicity (neuropathy, ocular) that influences sequencing and patient selection.\n  - Savolitinib + osimertinib: targeted EGFR+METamp resistance niche (SAVANNAH/SACHI): ctDNA clearance and PFS signals versus chemotherapy, creating a favored approach in MET‑amplified, EGFR‑mutant progression after osimertinib.\n  - Amivantamab (EGFR/MET bispecific): evolving SC formulation reduces infusion reactions; data in EGFR+MET contexts and practical prophylaxis strategies are being shared.\n  - New MET TKIs (DO‑2 deuterated MET inhibitor): early signs of activity and a different tolerability profile (notably less edema in early cohorts).\n- Market dynamics snapshot\n  - Tepotinib has a defensible position in METex14 via label and durability; however, ADCs and combination regimens create alternative pathways for MET‑altered patients (especially those selected by IHC or with EGFR co‑alterations). Rapid adoption of IHC CDx for ADCs and ctDNA guidance for combinations could fragment the MET patient flow.\n\n### Evidence Gaps and Unmet Needs\n- MET testing standardization: heterogeneous assays and cutoffs (RNA NGS for METex14 vs FISH/NGS quant for amplification vs IHC for protein OE) lead to inconsistent patient selection.\n- Sequencing evidence after ADCs/bispecifics: no prospective data define optimal sequencing (TKI → ADC → bispecific or ADC → TKI), particularly for METex14 patients who may be treated with ADCs because of IHC overlap.\n- CNS data beyond tepotinib: tepotinib shows intracranial responses (VISION, REAL‑MET), but prospective CNS endpoints for other MET agents are limited.\n- ctDNA as a routine early‑response tool: SACHI (1954P) supports ctDNA clearance as predictive — prospective trials tying ctDNA‑guided decisions to improved outcomes are lacking.\n- Elderly/ECOG≥2 and comorbidity populations: underrepresented in many trials; VISION included older patients but broader generalizability remains a question.\n\n---\n\n## What's Being Presented at ESMO 2025 in Lung Cancer\n\nBelow are the high‑priority abstracts that materially impact Tepotinib positioning. For regular abstracts we report the numbers as presented.\n\n### High‑Priority Studies (selected, with actionable implications)\n\n1) 1996P — VISION: Tepotinib 3‑year follow‑up in METex14 NSCLC (Phase II, NCT02864992)\n- Key data: tissue‑positive cohort (T+, n=208) ORR 54.8%; mDOR 17.4 months; mPFS 13.7 months; mOS 22.3 months. First‑line T+ subgroup (n=111) ORR 59.5%; mDOR 31.7 months.\n- Evidence gap addressed: long‑term durability and intracranial efficacy for tepotinib; supports 1L benefit.\n- Competitive implication: strengthens Tepotinib’s claim for durable systemic control and CNS activity vs ADCs (which often report higher ORR but shorter DoR) and newcomer TKIs — a core Medical Affairs message.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: emphasize the durable DOR in 1L and intracranial data when discussing sequencing and patient selection; cite 1996P in payer and testing dialogues.\n\n2) 1995P — VISION: Treatment sequencing & long‑term follow‑up\n- Key data: 1L cohort (n=164) ORR 57.9%, mDOR 31.7 months; 2L+ (n=149) ORR 45.0%, mDOR 12.6 months. Dose modifications: reductions 33.2%, interruptions 43.8%, discontinuations 15.7%. 65/145 progressed patients received subsequent MET inhibitors.\n- Evidence gap addressed: sequencing benefit of earlier use of tepotinib and real‑world dosing patterns.\n- Competitive implication: provides evidence to promote earlier use of Tepotinib and to set expectations on dose modifications.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: equip field with concrete figures on 1L vs later lines, and guidance on AE management to maintain exposure.\n\n3) 1998P — REAL‑MET: Real‑world tepotinib for patients with brain metastases (Japanese retrospective)\n- Key data: N=62 (15 with baseline brain mets). Systemic ORR 59% (brain mets) vs 69% (no brain mets); intracranial ORR evaluable subset (n=11) = 67%; mPFS roughly 8.3 mo (brain mets) vs 8.7 mo (no brain mets); mOS numerically worse for brain mets (16.6 vs 31.3 mo; p=0.07).\n- Evidence gap addressed: confirms real‑world intracranial activity but highlights poorer long‑term outcomes for patients with brain metastases.\n- Competitive implication: supports Tepotinib’s CNS activity claim; underscores need for integrated local/systemic approaches or earlier detection of brain disease.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: discuss intracranial response expectations and the importance of early testing and CNS surveillance.\n\n4) 1954P — SACHI (exploratory ctDNA analysis): Savolitinib + Osimertinib vs Chemotherapy in MET‑amplified EGFRm NSCLC\n- Key data: exploratory plasma NGS (Burning Rock) in 202 evaluable pts. EGFRm ctDNA clearance at C2/C3: 74% in savolitinib+osimertinib (46/62) vs 46% with chemotherapy (26/56). In patients with ctDNA clearance, mPFS was 11.6 months (combo) vs 6.9 months (chemo). Acquired MET mutations (10%) observed only in the combo arm.\n- Evidence gap addressed: demonstrates ctDNA dynamics as early pharmacodynamic marker and reveals therapy‑specific resistance patterns.\n- Competitive implication: positions savolitinib+osimertinib as a biomarker‑driven option in METamp EGFR‑mutant resistance; heightens importance of ctDNA monitoring.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: start discussions with KOLs about ctDNA integration in MET testing and explore observational data capturing ctDNA response in tepotinib cohorts.\n\n5) 1955P — SAVANNAH: Safety / tolerability of osimertinib + savolitinib (phase II safety dataset)\n- Key data (safety cohort n≈101 reported): hepatic AEs 35% (all grades) with 16% grade ≥3; peripheral edema 58% (11% grade ≥3); venous thromboembolism (VTE) 24% (7% grade 3). Dose interruptions/reductions common (osim interruptions 41%; savolitinib interruptions 48% and reductions 21%).\n- Evidence gap addressed: practical toxicity profile and mitigation needs for EGFR+MET combos.\n- Competitive implication: while combos are effective, toxicity burden and monitoring requirements could limit adoption — an area to highlight in safety comparisons.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: prepare AE management and monitoring guidance (LFTs, VTE vigilance) for clinicians comparing combo options.\n\n6) 1948P / 1951P / 1950P — Telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso‑V, LUMINOSITY) — efficacy, CDx transfer, ocular AEs\n- Key data: LUMINOSITY Stage I/II (n≈172): overall ORR 28.6% (95% CI 21.7–36.2); c‑MET high subgroup ORR 34.6% (95% CI 24.2–46.2); median DoR 8.3 months (c‑MET high DoR 9.0 months); ocular surface AEs in ~25% (mostly grade ≤2; median onset ~47 days). VENTANA MET SP44 CDx retesting showed concordant ORR (≈28–31% by CDx status). Dose modifications often preserved efficacy.\n- Evidence gap addressed: operationalizes IHC CDx for ADC selection and provides practical toxicity management guidance.\n- Competitive implication: Teliso‑V is a clear alternative for IHC‑selected MET‑overexpressing patients; CDx availability reduces testing friction and may accelerate adoption in centers that use IHC workflows.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: prepare balanced discussions on biomarker selection (METex14 vs MET IHC high) and tradeoffs between ORR and DoR/toxicity.\n\n7) 1960P — Amivantamab (SC formulation) + chemotherapy (cohort 3b)\n- Key data: investigator‑assessed ORR ~47% (ICR‑confirmed ~53%); mPFS ~7.9 months; low rates of infusion reactions with SC route (ARRs ~8% any grade, none grade 3); discontinuation for TRAEs 5%.\n- Evidence gap addressed: feasibility and operational advantages (SC) and intracranial activity data being pooled across programs.\n- Competitive implication: improved outpatient feasibility of amivantamab (SC) and prophylaxis approaches may increase adoption in EGFR+MET settings.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: discuss practical administration advantages and thrombosis/dermatologic AE mitigation when comparing to TKI approaches.\n\n8) 928P — DO‑2: First‑in‑human deuterated MET‑TKI (dose‑escalation)\n- Key data: n=26 across dose levels; confirmed PR in a treatment‑naïve METex14 patient; 8‑week DCR 76% overall; 100% DCR in 6 treatment‑naïve METex14 pts; grade 3 TRAEs 18%; notably no peripheral edema reported in early cohorts.\n- Evidence gap addressed: potential for differentiated tolerability (less edema) and activity from next‑generation chemistries.\n- Competitive implication: early tolerability advantages may attract clinicians if confirmed; monitor for expansion cohort outcomes.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: track safety differentiators and emphasize that cross‑trial comparisons are premature; focus on established VISION durability while monitoring DO‑2 progression.\n\n9) 1946P — MYTX‑011: pH‑dependent c‑MET ADC (KisMET‑01)\n- Key data (early phase I): activity reported across c‑MET low/intermediate/high tumors; ocular AEs and corneal epitheliopathy observed (class ADC signal).\n- Evidence gap addressed: ADC designs that claim broader activity across varying MET expression could expand the ADC‑eligible population.\n- Competitive implication: if validated, threatens the biomarker segmentation that favors MET TKIs (METex14 vs IHC).\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: reinforce the unique biology of METex14 and the need for splice‑aware testing before TKI decisions; discuss where ADCs appropriately fit.\n\n10) KUNPENG (vebreltinib / bozitinib) — Phase II in METex14 (reported in program highlights)\n- Key data: ORR overall 75.0% (95% CI 61.1–86.0), treatment‑naïve ORR 77.1%; median DoR 15.9 months; mPFS 14.1 months; mOS 20.7 months.\n- Evidence gap addressed: regional TKI with high ORR/duration signals — competitive in China.\n- Competitive implication: strong regional competition for Tepotinib in METex14 markets; monitor for global development/registrational plans.\n- How MA/MSLs can use it: in-market messaging should emphasize confirmatory data and generalizability; watch for regulatory filings outside China.\n\n---\n\n### Competitive Intelligence — practical takeaways\n- The most immediate threats to Tepotinib uptake in practice are:\n  - ADCs with validated IHC CDx (telisotuzumab vedotin) that reduce adoption friction in pathology‑driven workflows.\n  - EGFR+MET combination regimens (savolitinib + osimertinib; amivantamab combinations) that capture MET‑amplified EGFR‑mutant patients after osimertinib.\n  - New TKIs or regionally strong TKIs (vebreltinib, DO‑2) that report high ORR or differentiated tolerability.\n- Opportunities for Tepotinib to defend/grow share:\n  - Emphasize VISION’s long‑term durability and intracranial data (1996P/1995P) versus ADCs whose DoR and toxicity profiles differ.\n  - Push diagnostic algorithms (NGS/plasma for METex14) so the right patients are routed to Tepotinib.\n  - Leverage ctDNA (VISION plasma analyses; SACHI data) to argue for monitoring strategies that favor targeted use and early detection.\n\n### Evidence Gaps: what ESMO will address vs what will remain\n- Addressed at ESMO:\n  - Long‑term tepotinib durability and intracranial data (1996P/1995P).\n  - ctDNA dynamics showing early molecular clearance with MET+EGFR combos (1954P).\n  - Operational feasibility and toxicity management for ADCs and bispecifics (1948P/1950P/1960P).\n  - Early signals from novel MET TKIs (928P).\n- Likely to remain unresolved after ESMO:\n  - Prospective data defining optimal sequencing after ADCs/bispecifics (no randomized sequencing data presented).\n  - Standardized, cross‑platform diagnostic cutoffs harmonizing NGS/FISH/IHC for METamp vs METex14.\n  - Prospective interventional trials that use ctDNA clearance to trigger therapy changes with validated outcome benefit.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Considerations for Medical Affairs\n\nNote: these suggestions are framed as options Medical Affairs/field teams may want to consider during and after ESMO. They are tactical and evidence‑focused rather than operational mandates.\n\n### Ten Strategic Questions for KOL Engagement\n(Each question = short KOL prompt → why it matters → which ESMO abstracts inform it → Tepotinib relevance)\n\n1. How do you prioritize ORR vs durability (DoR) and intracranial control when choosing therapy for METex14 patients?\n   - Why it matters: ADCs can deliver higher initial ORR but shorter DoR; tepotinib shows long DoR (VISION 1996P).\n   - Informs: 1996P (VISION), 1948P (Teliso‑V LUMINOSITY).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: use VISION 3‑year DOR/CNS data when discussing long‑term disease control.\n\n2. What testing algorithm do you use to identify METex14 vs MET amplification vs MET protein overexpression in routine practice?\n   - Why it matters: test method determines therapy (TKI for METex14; ADC for IHC‑high).\n   - Informs: 1996P (VISION tissue vs liquid findings), 1951P (Teliso‑V CDx concordance), 1923P (METRIX assay reproducibility).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: promote RNA‑aware NGS + plasma CDx pathway to maximize METex14 capture.\n\n3. In EGFR‑mutated patients progressing on osimertinib with MET changes, how do you choose between osimertinib + savolitinib, amivantamab combinations, chemotherapy, or other options?\n   - Why it matters: multiple options exist with differing toxicity and durability.\n   - Informs: 1954P (SACHI ctDNA), 1955P (SAVANNAH safety), 1960P (amivantamab SC).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: clarify that Tepotinib’s label is METex14; discuss data needs for using a MET‑selective TKI in METamp scenarios.\n\n4. How do you integrate ctDNA in on‑treatment monitoring and early response assessment for MET‑driven disease?\n   - Why it matters: ctDNA clearance correlates with PFS in SACHI (1954P).\n   - Informs: 1954P (SACHI), VISION plasma analyses (1996P).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: explore observational ctDNA monitoring to show early pharmacodynamic effect and guide sequencing.\n\n5. What are your strategies for patients with baseline brain metastases and METex14 disease — systemic therapy alone, local therapy first, or combined approaches?\n   - Why it matters: REAL‑MET (1998P) and VISION (1996P) show intracranial responses but differing OS.\n   - Informs: 1998P (REAL‑MET), 1996P (VISION).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: position Tepotinib as a systemically active option with CNS activity; discuss integration with SRS/surgery.\n\n6. For patients receiving ADCs (telisotuzumab vedotin), what are your main concerns on cumulative neuropathy and ocular AEs and how do you modify dosing?\n   - Why it matters: ADC toxicity management is operational and affects patient selection.\n   - Informs: 1948P/1950P (LUMINOSITY ocular/neuropathy analyses).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: highlight TKI vs ADC toxicity tradeoffs for shared decision‑making.\n\n7. After ADC or bispecific progression, what data would influence you to use a MET TKI (eg, tepotinib)? Have you seen meaningful responses?\n   - Why it matters: sequencing knowledge is limited; RWE needed.\n   - Informs: LUMINOSITY follow‑on notes; absence of prospective sequencing data.\n   - Tepotinib relevance: discuss the rationale and seek real‑world cases where tepotinib demonstrated benefit post‑ADC.\n\n8. How comfortable are you using plasma CDx alone to initiate targeted therapy in METex14 cases?\n   - Why it matters: plasma CDx enables access but sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs influence decisions.\n   - Informs: 1996P (VISION tissue+/liquid+ subgroup differences).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: emphasize concordant tissue/liquid VISION data and the practical advantages for frail patients.\n\n9. What resistance mechanisms (on ctDNA) do you commonly see after MET‑targeted combinations, and how does that change your next therapy?\n   - Why it matters: SACHI shows therapy‑specific acquired resistance (MET mutations after combo).\n   - Informs: 1954P (SACHI).\n   - Tepotinib relevance: use this to discuss the need for serial ctDNA to guide sequencing and to inform sponsor translational strategy.\n\n10. Which real‑world evidence endpoints (time to next therapy, treatment patterns, real‑world PFS/OS) would be most persuasive for payers about Tepotinib’s value?\n    - Why it matters: payers prioritize durability, subsequent therapy avoidance and CNS control.\n    - Informs: VISION (1996P/1995P) durability data and REAL‑MET real‑world intracranial outcomes (1998P).\n    - Tepotinib relevance: propose targeted RWE endpoints to demonstrate value.\n\n---\n\n### Ten High‑Value Discussion Topics (with angles and evidence)\n\n1. Diagnostic algorithm for MET alterations\n   - Angles: RNA‑aware tissue NGS for METex14; plasma CDx for access; reflex IHC/FISH for METamp confirmation.\n   - Evidence: VISION (1996P) tissue vs liquid, Teliso‑V CDx (1951P), METRIX assay work.\n   - How Tepotinib fits: stress plasma CDx complementarity for METex14 capture.\n\n2. Sequencing strategy: TKI → ADC → bispecific or ADC → TKI?\n   - Angles: ORR vs DoR tradeoffs, toxicity profiles, and patient goals (symptom control vs durable disease control).\n   - Evidence: VISION (1996P), LUMINOSITY (1948P), amivantamab cohort (1960P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: position Tepotinib for durable disease control especially when CNS control is needed.\n\n3. ctDNA as an early pharmacodynamic marker\n   - Angles: on‑treatment clearance predicts PFS; sampling cadence and analytical platforms.\n   - Evidence: SACHI (1954P), VISION plasma analyses (1996P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: justify observational ctDNA monitoring in clinical practice/RWE.\n\n4. Managing ADC toxicities and dose modifications\n   - Angles: neuropathy prevention/monitoring, ocular prophylaxis and early ophthalmology referral, dose‑holding rules.\n   - Evidence: LUMINOSITY toxicity and dose modification analyses (1948P,1950P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: compare TKI tolerability and dose‑modification strategies.\n\n5. Practical AE management for EGFR+MET combos\n   - Angles: liver monitoring, edema management, VTE risk mitigation (when to consider prophylaxis).\n   - Evidence: SAVANNAH safety (1955P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: discuss single‑agent TKI vs combo safety tradeoffs.\n\n6. CNS disease management in METex14\n   - Angles: intracranial response rates, timing of SRS vs systemic therapy, endpoints for trials.\n   - Evidence: VISION intracranial analyses (1996P), REAL‑MET (1998P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: highlight intracranial activity and potential to delay local therapy in selected pts.\n\n7. Use of plasma CDx in limited‑resource settings\n   - Angles: access to NGS vs IHC, turnaround time, reimbursement pathways.\n   - Evidence: VISION tissue/liquid findings (1996P), Teliso‑V CDx (1951P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: argue plasma CDx as a practical capture tool for METex14.\n\n8. Interpreting emerging MET TKI data (DO‑2, vebreltinib)\n   - Angles: cross‑trial comparability limits; need for confirmatory/active‑comparator data.\n   - Evidence: DO‑2 early results (928P), KUNPENG vebreltinib signals.\n   - How Tepotinib fits: maintain emphasis on mature follow‑up and confirmed CNS activity.\n\n9. Real‑world sequencing and barriers to subsequent therapy\n   - Angles: why patients with brain mets receive fewer subsequent lines (REAL‑MET), logistics/costs that limit sequencing.\n   - Evidence: REAL‑MET (1998P).\n   - How Tepotinib fits: discuss early testing and referral to preserve sequencing options.\n\n10. Health‑economic considerations for MET agent choice\n    - Angles: upfront ORR vs duration (cost per month of disease control), outpatient administration (SC amivantamab), monitoring costs (ctDNA).\n    - Evidence: AMI SC data (1960P), Teliso‑V DoR (1948P), SACHI ctDNA (1954P).\n    - How Tepotinib fits: position based on durable disease control, reduced monitoring needs vs complex combo regimens.\n\n---\n\n### Ten Objection Handling Frameworks (scenario → structured response)\n\nFormat: Acknowledge → Context → Evidence → Differentiate → Position\n\n1. Objection: “Teliso‑V has higher ORR — why not give ADC first?”\n   - Acknowledge: “Good point — initial tumor shrinkage matters for symptomatic control.”\n   - Context: ADCs target c‑MET IHC high; ORR is important for rapid shrinkage.\n   - Evidence: Teliso‑V LUMINOSITY (1948P) ORR 28.6% overall, 34.6% in c‑MET high; median DoR 8.3 months.\n   - Differentiate: VISION (1996P) shows tepotinib durable DOR (17.4 months T+; 31.7 months 1L) and intracranial activity; toxicity differences (ADC neuropathy/ocular vs TKI edema) affect long‑term tolerability.\n   - Position: For patients where durable systemic and CNS control is the priority, Tepotinib is the evidence‑based choice; for immediate tumor shrinkage in IHC‑selected refractory patients, ADCs are an option — selection should be biomarker driven.\n\n2. Objection: “New TKIs (vebreltinib/DO‑2) report very high ORR — is Tepotinib obsolete?”\n   - Acknowledge: “New agents with strong early ORR are noteworthy.”\n   - Context: Early‑phase signals can be promising but need mature follow‑up and broader populations.\n   - Evidence: DO‑2 (928P) early PRs and 8‑week DCR; vebreltinib (KUNPENG) high ORR but regional data.\n   - Differentiate: Tepotinib has 3‑year VISION durability and intracranial data (1996P) across global cohorts.\n   - Position: Monitor newcomers closely; Tepotinib’s mature durability/CNS evidence remains a practical differentiator today.\n\n3. Objection: “Savolitinib+osimertinib clears ctDNA faster — shouldn’t we use that combo?”\n   - Acknowledge: “ctDNA clearance is compelling as an early biomarker.”\n   - Context: SACHI (1954P) shows higher ctDNA clearance and associated PFS benefit vs chemo in METamp EGFRm disease.\n   - Evidence: ctDNA clearance 74% (combo) vs 46% (chemo); cleared‑patient mPFS 11.6 vs 6.9 months.\n   - Differentiate: Savolitinib+osimertinib addresses METamp in EGFR‑mutant resistance; Tepotinib’s label is METex14 — these are different biomarker populations.\n   - Position: For METamp in EGFR‑mutant resistance consider combo approaches supported by ctDNA; for METex14, Tepotinib’s targeted monotherapy has robust single‑agent durability.\n\n4. Objection: “I’m worried about edema and hepatic toxicity with MET TKIs.”\n   - Acknowledge: “Safety is a key factor for patient quality of life.”\n   - Context: SAVANNAH (1955P) reports edema and hepatotoxicity in combinations; VISION long‑term safety is consistent with known class effects.\n   - Evidence: SAVANNAH: edema 58% (11% grade ≥3), hepatotoxicity 35% (16% grade ≥3). VISION: manageable long‑term safety with dose modifications (1995P).\n   - Differentiate: Tepotinib’s long‑term experience gives clear guidance on monitoring and dose‑modification strategies (33% dose reductions in VISION).\n   - Position: Offer practical monitoring algorithms (LFT schedule, edema management) and highlight that dose modifications preserved benefit in VISION.\n\n5. Objection: “How reliable is plasma CDx for starting therapy?”\n   - Acknowledge: “Test accuracy is critical when starting targeted therapy.”\n   - Context: VISION included tissue and liquid subgroups; plasma helps capture inaccessible tumors.\n   - Evidence: VISION (1996P) reported outcomes by tissue vs liquid detection; plasma detection associated with higher tumor burden and prognostic differences.\n   - Differentiate: Plasma CDx expands access but requires confirmatory clinical context; for symptomatic, rapidly progressing patients plasma results can be used pragmatically.\n   - Position: Use plasma CDx per label/algorithm — emphasize validation and concordance from VISION subgroup data.\n\n6. Objection: “Teliso‑V ocular events worry me — are ADC toxicities manageable in elderly pts?”\n   - Acknowledge: “Ocular and neuropathic AEs affect older patients particularly.”\n   - Context/Evidence: LUMINOSITY ocular AEs ~25% (mostly grade ≤2), neuropathy common (1948P/1950P); dose modifications preserved efficacy.\n   - Differentiate: Tepotinib toxicity profile is different — edema and manageable lab abnormalities vs ADC cumulative neuropathy/ocular.\n   - Position: For frail/elderly patients where neuropathy risk is high, Tepotinib is a reasonable first choice; for IHC‑select high tumor burden where quick shrinkage matters, ADCs may still be considered with careful monitoring.\n\n7. Objection: “Will tepotinib work after telisotuzumab or amivantamab?”\n   - Acknowledge: “Sequencing is an area with limited prospective data.”\n   - Context: ESMO LUMINOSITY analyses describe subsequent therapies but prospective post‑ADC sequencing data are limited.\n   - Evidence: LUMINOSITY exploratory results show patients received subsequent MET inhibitors, but outcomes are descriptive (1948P).\n   - Differentiate: Mechanistic rationale exists for TKI activity after ADC/bispecific progression if METex14 is retained; prospective RWE is needed.\n   - Position: Consider tepotinib in METex14 patients post‑ADC where METex14 persists; collect RWE and encourage case reporting to build evidence.\n\n8. Objection: “I prefer chemo + IO in older patients rather than targeted agents.”\n   - Acknowledge: “Chemo + IO is a standard first‑line for many driver‑negative patients.”\n   - Context: For driver‑positive METex14, targeted agents produce higher response and durability compared with chemo ± IO.\n   - Evidence: VISION 1L subgroup (1996P) shows ORR 59.5% and long mDOR 31.7 months in 1L.\n   - Differentiate: In METex14, targeted therapy often delivers better disease control and toxicity profile tailored to driver biology.\n   - Position: Recommend testing to identify METex14 upfront so patients can be offered targeted therapy rather than empiric chemo/IO.\n\n9. Objection: “Emerging TKIs claim less edema — is that clinically meaningful?”\n   - Acknowledge: “Lower incidence of a bothersome AE is attractive.”\n   - Context/Evidence: DO‑2 (928P) reports no peripheral edema in early cohorts; sample sizes are small.\n   - Differentiate: Tepotinib has large, mature data; early tolerability signals need confirmation in larger cohorts and across real‑world patients.\n   - Position: Watch DO‑2 expansion data; continue to use tepotinib’s known management pathways until larger confirmatory datasets exist.\n\n10. Objection: “Payers ask me for head‑to‑head data vs other MET agents — we don’t have it.”\n    - Acknowledge: “Head‑to‑head randomized data are scarce in METex14.”\n    - Context: Cross‑trial comparisons are common but unreliable.\n    - Differentiate: Tepotinib’s strength is matured, long‑term follow‑up (VISION); payers value durability, intracranial control and real‑world effectiveness.\n    - Position: Provide RWE, indirect treatment comparisons where methodologically sound, and emphasize durability/CNS endpoints in value dossiers.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence‑Generation Priorities (practical, staged suggestions)\n\nImmediate priorities (high strategic value, low resource requirement — actions to start During/Immediately After ESMO)\n- Rapid field materials: produce updated MSL slide deck and single‑page synthesis comparing VISION (1996P/1995P) vs LUMINOSITY (1948P), SACHI (1954P) and SAVANNAH (1955P) keyed to clinician questions.\n- Post‑hoc VISION subgroup analyses: prioritize internal analyses emphasizing intracranial responses, 1L vs later line outcomes and plasma vs tissue subgroups for dissemination at ESMO.\n- Comparator safety Q&A: practical scripts for MSLs on edema/liver monitoring (SAVANNAH), neuropathy/ocular risk (LUMINOSITY), and thrombosis (amivantamab).\n- Diagnostics guidance: create an actionable “MET testing algorithm” one‑pager (NGS/RNA → plasma CDx → IHC reflex for ADC candidacy) referencing VISION and Teliso‑V CDx data.\n- KOL roundtables: short advisory discussions (virtual/at‑ESMO) focused on sequencing (post‑ADC/TKI) and ctDNA monitoring — not a directive, but an early listening step.\n\nMedium‑term opportunities (moderate investment, 6–18 month horizon)\n- Prospective observational RWE registry: track METex14 patients treated with Tepotinib, capture ctDNA dynamics, CNS outcomes, and post‑ADC/bispecific sequencing outcomes (goal: multi‑center investigator‑initiated program).\n- Biomarker harmonization study (investigator collaborative): compare tissue RNA NGS, plasma ctDNA and IHC/FISH across sites to define operational cutoffs and workflows (builds on VISION and METRIX efforts).\n- Small investigator‑initiated sequencing cohorts: capture tepotinib activity after telisotuzumab vedotin or amivantamab progression (single‑arm, real‑world pragmatic cohorts).\n- Safety and tolerability resource development: ophthalmology and neurology referral pathways for centers using ADCs and procedural guidance for edema/VTE monitoring in MET combinations.\n\nLonger‑term considerations (major investment; consider only if strategic imperative)\n- Large comparative effectiveness RWE program (multi‑country) to evaluate time to next therapy, CNS outcomes and OS across MET TKIs and ADCs — may inform label/HTA dossiers.\n- Strategic translational program to prospectively collect serial ctDNA and tissue at progression to characterize acquired resistance architectures across ADCs, bispecifics and TKIs and identify salvage strategies (may inform future combination development).\n\n---\n\n## At ESMO: Priority Engagement (who/what to prioritize)\n\nSuggested KOLs to meet (high strategic value; pick a small set to focus time):\n- Frank Griesinger — University of Oldenburg (VISION lead; 1996P/1995P). Discussion: long‑term intracranial outcomes, dose modification impact on DOR.\n- John Heymach — MD Anderson (ctDNA/radiomics expert; LBA70).

Mansfield — Mayo Clinic (Teliso‑V presenter, LUMINOSITY 1948P).\n- Yongfeng Yu — Shanghai Chest Hospital (SACHI ctDNA 1954P).\n- Antonio Passaro — European Institute of Oncology (ADC & MET resistance expert).\n- Enriqueta Felip — Vall d'Hebron (amivantamab/ADC expertise).\n- Julia Rotow — Dana‑Farber (real‑world MET testing and sequencing 1967P).\n- Niels Reinmuth — eAsklepios Lung Clinic (ADC/diagnostics symposium lead).\n- Martin Reck — Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf (guideline influence; symposium chair).\n- Maximilian Hochmair — Karl Landsteiner Institute (EGFR sequencing and VTE guidance for bispecifics).\n\n---\n\nFinal note: At ESMO, our most defensible messages are evidence‑led: cite VISION’s long‑term durability and intracranial activity (1996P/1995P); pair those data with practical diagnostic guidance (tissue RNA NGS + plasma CDx) so appropriate patients are routed to Tepotinib. During ESMO, Medical Affairs may want to prioritize rapid field enablement (comparator Q&A, diagnostic algorithm one‑pager, and a ctDNA monitoring primer), while leadership may want to monitor competitor regulatory moves and consider targeted RWE investments to protect and grow Tepotinib’s position."
