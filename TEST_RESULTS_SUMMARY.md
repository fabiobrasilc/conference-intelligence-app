## Detailed Query Scenarios

### MSL Queries (Tactical, Field-Facing)

#### 1. "What are the latest pembrolizumab combination studies in bladder cancer?"
**Context**: MSL preparing for KOL meeting

**Results**:
- Count: 154 studies
- Type: list_filtered
- Includes: Combination regimens, biomarker studies, phase 2/3 trials

**Sample Results**:
- LBA110: Nivolumab + visugromab trial
- LBA112: TAR-200 + cetrelimab neoadjuvant
- 3070MO: FGFR3 inhibitor combinations

**AI Synthesis**: Would provide quick summary of combination landscape

---

#### 2. "Show me all EV + P studies"
**Context**: MSL needs EV-302 regimen data

**Results**:
- Count: **10 studies** ✅ (matches manual verification)
- Type: list_filtered
- Logic: AND (both drugs required)

**Validation**:
- Entity resolver: "EV" → "enfortumab vedotin", "P" → "pembrolizumab"
- Search: Multi-field (Title, Session, Theme, etc.)
- Logic: Combination (AND)

**Sample Studies**:
- LBA2: Perioperative EV + pembro in MIBC (KEYNOTE-905)
- 3094P: Prognostic scores validation for EV/P
- 3089P: Clinical outcomes with EV + pembro in mUC
- 3102P: EV + pembro in FGFR3/ERBB2-altered mUC

**AI Output**: Quick summary of EV+P combination data

---

#### 3. "Which institutions are presenting on avelumab maintenance?"
**Context**: MSL identifying KOLs

**Results**:
- Count: 154 studies (broad bladder filter)
